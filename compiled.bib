abstract = {Adopting Advanced Machine Learning for Smart Grids (ML-SG) is a promising strategy that revolutionizes the energy industry to optimize energy usage, improve grid management, and foster sustainability. It also increases the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of contemporary power systems. Furthermore, incorporating machine learning into smart grids has important practical ramifications and can help address some of the most pressing issues facing contemporary energy systems. By precisely forecasting consumption trends and facilitating dynamic pricing models that take into account current grid circumstances, Machine Learning (ML) can improve demand response tactics. Additionally, it is essential for preserving grid stability since it can promptly identify irregularities and react to system oscillations, preventing blackouts and equipment failures. Furthermore, through supply and demand balance, energy dispatch optimization, and solar and wind power forecasts, ML makes it easier to seamlessly integrate renewable energy sources. These characteristics facilitate the shift to a more robust, adaptable, and ecologically friendly energy infrastructure in addition to increasing operating efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the development of ML solutions that benefit from the enormous amounts of data generated by IoT devices in the smart grid. Furthermore, this study examines the benefits and drawbacks of the adoption of ML-SG and offers an outline of their use while highlighting the implications of integrating ML into smart grids. In addition, it explores and analyzes how ML algorithms can be used for load forecasting and enabling accurate and real-time decision making in smart grids. The objective of this work is to analyze smart grid operations at different levels, such as predicting energy demand, identifying abnormalities, and reducing cybersecurity threats by using sophisticated ML-based algorithms, especially discussing attacks and countermeasures against these ML models. This work concludes with suggestions and recommendations that highlight the importance of improving the security and accuracy of ML-SG, while shedding some light on future directions. In the future, this work aims to contribute to the development of efficient ML solutions for energy infrastructure to become more effective and sustainable, by discussing data science and ML issues related to smart grids.}

abstract = {A considerable body of research deals with the automatic identification of hate speech and related phenomena. However, cross-dataset model generalization remains a challenge. In this context, we address two still open central questions: (i) to what extent does the generalization depend on the model and the composition and annotation of the training data in terms of different categories?, and (ii) do specific features of the datasets or models influence the generalization potential? To answer (i), we experiment with BERT, ALBERT, fastText, and SVM models trained on nine common public English datasets, whose class (or category) labels are standardized (and thus made comparable), in intra- and cross-dataset setups. The experiments show that indeed the generalization varies from model to model and that some of the categories (e.g., ‘toxic’, ‘abusive’, or ‘offensive’) serve better as cross-dataset training categories than others (e.g., ‘hate speech’). To answer (ii), we use a Random Forest model for assessing the relevance of different model and dataset features during the prediction of the performance of 450 BERT, 450 ALBERT, 450 fastText, and 348 SVM binary abusive language classifiers (1698 in total). We find that in order to generalize well, a model already needs to perform well in an intra-dataset scenario. Furthermore, we find that some other parameters are equally decisive for the success of the generalization, including, e.g., the training and target categories and the percentage of the out-of-domain vocabulary.}

We propose a novel approach for cross-domain topic transfer learning by combining feature fusion and balancing data and labels.

Additionally, we introduce a topic knowledge distillation method, leveraging topics from the source domain to guide and optimize topic generation in the target domain.

Through these forums, people can share their views and experiences. These platforms enable discussion about a certain product that can be a valuable resource used to inform any decision-making process. For such studies, the majority of advanced-level researchers employed deep learning and machine learning models in conjunction with natural language processing (NLP). In recent years, the use of pre-trained models, such as Glove and BERT, in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has increased. In ABSA, the auxiliary information is required to distinguish each aspect of this fine-grained task. However, BERT’s input format is restricted to a collection of words that cannot include more context knowledge. To address this problem, a BiLSTM and embedded CNN-based deep learning model has been presented for sentiment analysis at the aspect level. Initially, datasets were compiled from several sources. Then, an auxiliary feature was extracted using standard NLP. The auxiliary features were further refined and transformed into feature vectors based on the proposed embedded CNN model. Finally, a BiLSTM-based classification has been performed for sentiment classification. The experimental evaluation demonstrated that the performance of the suggested technique achieves on the SemEval dataset in terms of F1 score and accuracy by 81.7 and 83.3 percentage points, respectively, and on the product review dataset by 80.8 and 83.1 percentage points, respectively.}

These reviews are also a very precious source of information for requirement engineers. But companies and consumers are not very satisfied with the overall sentiment; they like fine-grained knowledge about consumer reviews. Owing to this, many researchers have developed approaches for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Most existing approaches concentrate on explicit aspects to analyze the sentiment, and only a few studies rely on capturing implicit aspects. This paper proposes a Keywords-Based Aspect Extraction method, which captures both explicit and implicit aspects. It also captures opinion words and classifies the sentiment about each aspect. We applied semantic similarity-based WordNet and SentiWordNet lexicon to improve aspect extraction. We used different collections of customer reviews for experiment purposes, consisting of eight datasets over seven domains.

abstract = {The fast growth of today's technology on social media, the web, etc caused the ongoing and fast creation of opinionated textual data. In this context, internet reviews by consumers determine upcoming consumers whether can buy a particular product or not. Because the thoughts regarding the products are expressed by commenting on reviews. The sentiment analysis is more supportive for comprehending feedback and the attitude of consumers regarding the product’s characteristics. More sentiment classification tasks are carried out by the researchers but attained low level output due to difficulty in learning contextual words. To rectify this type of issue, current work focuses on developing a sentiment analysis framework by progressive techniques. The novel namely Ensemble Attention Enhanced Bidirectional Long-short-term Encoder (EAE-BiLE) is developed. The developed method analyzes online reviews and gains reviews from Amazon and the second task is to form high-quality input. The BERT model generates contextual word embeddings and Bi-directional Long-Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) processes these embeddings in order to capture both backward and forward dependencies from the text. The novel method makes the accurate classification by focusing on important and relevant parts in the text using an attention mechanism that assigns different weights. Detailed experiments that expose the performance of the developed method are performed in this work. This requires a few evaluation metrics that can measure the effectiveness of the developed method, which is accomplished by F1-score, recall, accuracy, and precision. The developed EAE-BiLE framework yields higher rates of 97.2 %, 97.2 %, 99.1 %, and 98.4 % for precision, F1-score, accuracy, and recall. Its error performance is also low, which represents the developed method makes the precise classification. The developed EAE-BiLE excels with higher effectiveness than prior techniques for efficacious sentiment classification.}

Massive amounts of user-generated data sourced from various social networking platforms also provide new insights for businesses and governments. However, it has become difficult to extract useful information from the vast amount of information effectively. Sentiment analysis provides an automated method of analyzing sentiment, emotion and opinion in written language to address this issue. In the existing literature, a large number of scholars have worked on improving the performance of various sentiment classifiers or applying them to various domains using data from social networking platforms. This paper explores the challenges that scholars have encountered and other potential problems in studying sentiment analysis in social media. It gives insights into the goals of the sentiment analysis task, the implementation process, and the ways in which it is utilized in various application domains. It also provides a comparison of different studies and highlights several challenges related to the datasets, text languages, analysis methods and evaluation metrics. The paper contributes to the research on sentiment analysis and can help practitioners select a suitable methodology for their applications.}

Three deep learning models are designed and trained on the cleaned dataset: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are checked to rate their performance. Between them CNN shows better performance at its training accuracy at 99% and validation accuracy at 91%.

One of the major advantages of these websites is the accessibility and reach to the users of these platforms. These platforms do not demarcate information cascading based on geography, race, caste, and creed to name a few. The prediction of a cascade is an important problem as it gives a deep understanding of opinion-shaping in audience. For eg. diffusion about a product, politics for, example, celebrity popularity. Many models have been proposed for solving this problem that uses content and user-based information, temporal and structural features of the network. Propagation is faster if the similarity between entities is high. In this paper, we propose a random walk based method that also exploits similarity measures (user and content) to predict the diffusion cascade. We evaluated our method using Twitter as a use case and demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing structural and content-based methods being proposed earlier.}

The existing studies have focused on the SA of single modalities, such as texts or photos, posing challenges in effectively handling social media data with multiple modalities. Moreover, most multimodal research has concentrated on merely combining the two modalities rather than exploring their complex correlations, leading to unsatisfactory sentiment classification results. Motivated by this, we propose a new visual-textual sentiment classification model named Multi-Model Fusion (MMF), which uses a mixed fusion framework for SA to effectively capture the essential information and the intrinsic relationship between the visual and textual content. The proposed model comprises three deep neural networks. Two different neural networks are proposed to extract the most emotionally relevant aspects of image and text data. Thus, more discriminative features are gathered for accurate sentiment classification. Then, a multichannel joint fusion model with a self-attention technique is proposed to exploit the intrinsic correlation between visual and textual characteristics and obtain emotionally rich information for joint sentiment classification. Finally, the results of the three classifiers are integrated using a decision fusion scheme to improve the robustness and generalizability of the proposed model. An interpretable visual-textual sentiment classification model is further developed using the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation model (LIME) to ensure the model’s explainability and resilience. The proposed MMF model has been tested on four real-world sentiment datasets, achieving (99.78%) accuracy on Binary_Getty (BG), (99.12%) on Binary_iStock (BIS), (95.70%) on Twitter, and (79.06%) on the Multi-View Sentiment Analysis (MVSA) dataset. These results demonstrate the superior performance of our MMF model compared to single-model approaches and current state-of-the-art techniques based on model evaluation criteria.}

Ideally, when models are pre-trained on large amount of data, they are expected to gain implicit knowledge. In this paper, we investigate the ability of pre-trained language models to generalize to different non-language tasks. In particular, we test them on tasks from different domains such as computer vision, reasoning on hierarchical data, and protein fold prediction. The four pre-trained models that we used, T5, BART, BERT, and GPT-2 achieve outstanding results. They all have similar performance and they outperform transformers that are trained from scratch by a large margin. For instance, pre-trained language models perform better on the Listops dataset, with an average accuracy of 58.7%, compared to transformers trained from scratch, which have an average accuracy of 29.0%. The significant improvement demonstrated across three types of datasets suggests that pre-training on language helps the models to acquire general knowledge, bringing us a step closer to general AI. We also showed that reducing the number of parameters in pre-trained language models does not have a great impact as the performance drops slightly when using T5-Small instead of T5-Base. In fact, when using only 2% of the parameters, we achieved a great improvement compared to training from scratch. Finally, in contrast to prior work, we find out that using pre-trained embeddings for the input layer is necessary to achieve the desired results.}

Traditional approaches often rely on either technical indicators or sentiment analysis, limiting their ability to capture the interplay between diverse data modalities. This research work introduces a novel multimodal deep learning framework that integrates technical analysis and sentiment analysis through a cross-modal attention mechanism, enabling a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. The proposed model leverages innovative alignment techniques to synchronize sentiment from news articles with historical price trends, facilitating robust multiclass prediction of Forex price directions. To evaluate its effectiveness, the model was tested on three major currency pairs—EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY—using k-fold cross-validation. Multiple attention configurations, including no attention, self-attention, bi-cross attention, and a hybrid approach, were implemented to assess the impact of attention mechanisms on prediction performance. Experimental results highlight the superiority of the hybrid attention mechanism, which consistently outperformed single-modality models and other configurations across key metrics, such as Matthew's correlation coefficient, accuracy, directional accuracy, and F1-score. These findings underscore the importance of integrating sentiment and technical data for enhanced Forex prediction. This study contributes to the growing field of multimodal financial forecasting, offering a foundation for future research incorporating advanced risk metrics, real-time trading systems, and broader market applications.}

This feedback can be collected from open-ended survey questions, interviews, crowdsourced data, or innovative home automation technology that can transform voice inputs into text. However, manual text data processing is time-consuming and requires significant efforts to extract relevant insights, such as text classification into IEQ categories (i.e., visual, thermal, air quality and acoustic). Most IEQ studies that automated text feedback classification into IEQ categories relied on keyword matching, which cannot understand the context of some keywords, potentially leading to incorrect classification. To address this issue, we automated the detection and categorisation of unstructured IEQ feedback by adopting the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model architecture and fine-tuning it on 14,622 manually labelled IEQ text feedback. The resulting model, IEQ-BERT, achieved a prediction accuracy of 93 % and macro average precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.93, 0.94, and 0.93, respectively, across the five considered classes (i.e., acoustic, indoor air quality, thermal, visual, or No IEQ). Therefore, the model can effectively distinguish text concerning IEQ and identify which IEQ domain – acoustic, indoor air quality, thermal, visual, or their combinations – is being reported. IEQ-BERT can be used alone or integrated into building automation systems to identify patterns and trends of occupant feedback, prioritise areas for improvement, and support the development of targeted strategies to improve IEQ. This research contributes to developing efficient methods for analysing occupant feedback, ultimately leading to improved building performance and occupant quality of life.}

Conversations in clinical settings, especially those involving hematologic cancers or palliative care are not only informational but also emotionally charged. Understanding how these conversations are structured could help develop AI systems that support not only information exchange but also personalized emotional care.
Objective
This study explored the themes discussed and emotional tones in real conversations between Greek speaking clinicians and patients. Our aim was to contribute toward building digital tools for low-resource languages such as Greek that are not only linguistically appropriate but also emotionally aware.
Methods
We analyzed over 52,000 anonymized utterances from real Greek clinical conversations using BERTopic for topic modeling and a domain-specific sentiment classifier fine-tuned on Greek medical data. Topics were labeled using both a large language model (Gemma-3) and extractive keyword methods (KeyBERT).
Results
The analysis revealed 35 thematic clusters, covering areas like symptoms, diagnosis, emotional states, treatment choices, and end-of-life planning. Sentiment analysis revealed that patients expressed more negative sentiment in utterances related to pain, uncertainty or personal loss. Clinicians often responded with a more neutral or even empathetic positive tone, especially when offering support or medical advice.
Conclusions
Our findings show that Natural Language Processing (NLP) can reveal both the content and emotional tone of conversations in medical settings. This approach could support the development of digital health tools such as conversational agents that are more emotionally aware in Greek and other low-resource languages, especially in emotionally charged domains like palliative care.}

In some real-world exercises, where data collection has become difficult, the above assumption does not hold true. Even, if possible, the scarcity of rightful data prevents the model from being successfully trained. Compensating for outdated data, reducing the need and hardship of recollecting the training data, avoiding many expensive data labeling efforts, and improving the foreseen accuracy of testing data are some significant contributions of transfer learning in the real-world application. The most cited transfer learning application includes classification, regression, and clustering problems in activity recognition, image and video classification, wi-fi localization, detection and tracking, sentiment analysis and classification, and web-document classification. Human activity recognition plays a cardinal role in human- to-human and human-to-object interaction and interpersonal relations. Pairing with robust deep learning algorithms and improved hardware technologies, automatic recognition of human activity has opened the door in the direction of constructing a smart society. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first to link machine learning, transfer learning, and vision sensor-based activity recognition under one roof..

Supervised learning with naïve-Bayes, non-linear support vector machine with radial basis function kernels, and random forests with CART decision trees was measured by a micro-aggregated Matthews correlation coefficient and a macro-averaged F1 measure. Random forests outperformed support vector machines by almost 250% and naive-Bayes by 600% on the two evaluation metrics. All models did better with three rating levels, instead of five. Topic modeling and stacked cluster analysis were coupled with parts-of-speech tagging and text mining operations to establish a robust data preprocessing procedure to eliminate noisy features from the data. Unsupervised topic modeling and clustering represented an exploratory validation of how easy supervised classification would be. Well-defined latent topics were discovered including topics on “sleep quality”, “the opportunity to get back to work”, and “weight gain”. Overlapping clusters revealed that incorporating more information on social, demographic, or medical history variables could improve classifier performance.

A customer conveys their opinion in natural language about an entity. Applying sentiment analysis to those reviews is a very complex task. The significant terms that influence the polarity of a review are not examined. The terms that have contextual meaning are not recognized and are present across multiple sentences in a review. To address the above two issues, the authors have proposed an attention-based convolution bi-directional recurrent neural network (ACBRNN). In this model, two convolution layer captures phrase-level feature while self-attention in the middle assigns high weight to the significant terms, and bi-directional GRU performs a conceptual scanning of review through forward and backward direction. The authors have conducted four different experiments (i.e., unidirectional, bidirectional, hybrid, and proposed model) on IMDB dataset to show the significance of the proposed model. The proposed model has obtained an F1 score of 87.94% on IMDB dataset, which is 5.41% higher than CNN. Thus, the proposed architecture performs well compared with all other baseline models.}

abstract = {SMS spam detection remains a critical challenge in digital communication systems, particularly in agriculture where farmers depend on SMS services for weather updates, crop prices, and government notifications. Traditional spam detection methods fail to handle evolving spam tactics and class imbalance effectively. This paper proposes a hybrid ensemble model that combines ALBERT transformer embeddings with BiLSTM networks enhanced by attention mechanisms and knowledge distillation. Experimental evaluation on the SMS Spam Collection dataset demonstrates superior performance with 98% accuracy, 0.98 precision, 0.97 recall, and 0.98 F1-score. The ensemble model significantly outperforms individual ALBERT (88% accuracy) and BiLSTM (54% accuracy) models. Knowledge distillation reduces model size from 425 MB to 67 MB, enabling real-time deployment with 0.045-second processing time per message. The system achieves 22.2 messages per second throughput, making it suitable for practical applications. Real-world testing in agricultural communication networks demonstrates significant improvements in spam filtering compared to traditional keyword-based filters. The hybrid approach provides an effective solution for SMS spam detection with demonstrated real-time performance and practical applicability in resource-constrained environments.}

In UUR, data may be in noisy state, irrelevant features exist which creates high dimensional feature space. To design an effective sentiment learning model, users are required to extract the most relevant sentiment features from UUR. To overcome the issue, we proposed a Linguistic rule based feature selection method for extracting and selecting the sentiment features for Sentiment Analysis as it improves the predictive performance of classification algorithms. The proposed novel feature selection method involves identifying the various sentiment features in the review dataset by using filtering methods such as POS tags, n-grams. In the ensemble model, where the Random Forest classification algorithm is trained for textual sentiment classification, the chosen sentiment feature sets are used. Finally, we test our approach using the real-time review dataset that was collected from a multitude of sources, and the results demonstrate prediction accuracy that is superior to that of existing Sentiment analysis techniques.}

While this characteristic of Parkinsonian speech has been supported through the perspective of listeners, where both PD and healthy control (HC) subjects repeat the same speaking tasks, it has never been explored through a machine learning modelling approach. Our work provides an objective evaluation of this characteristic of the PD speech, by building a transfer learning system to assess how the PD pathology affects the sadness perception. To do so we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for speech emotion recognition designed to be transferable across datasets. Firstly, by relying on publicly available emotional speech corpora, we train the MoE model and then we use it to quantify perceived sadness in never seen before PD and matched HC speech recordings. To build our models (experts), we extracted spectral features of the voicing parts of speech and we trained a gradient boosting decision trees model in each corpus to predict happiness vs. sadness. MoE predictions are created by weighting each expert's prediction according to the distance between the new sample and the expert-specific training samples. The MoE approach systematically infers more negative emotional characteristics in PD speech than in HC. Crucially, these judgments are related to the disease severity and the severity of speech impairment in the PD patients: the more impairment, the more likely the speech is to be judged as sad. Our findings pave the way towards a better understanding of the characteristics of PD speech and show how publicly available datasets can be used to train models that provide interesting insights on clinical data.}

Analysis of the sentiments of social media data is very difficult to understand as this typically does not exhibit a suspicious pattern in the flow of information like individual's actual opinion on a specific occasion etc. With the advancement of methodology and easy to use, the users of social media sites are now expressing their opinions, sharing their views and experiences through images, text, animation, audio, video etc. Because of the complexity the conventional text based sentiment analysis procedure, a lot of methods have been evolved, however studies suggest mostly more complicated procedure and approaches. Twitter® (or X), is one of the most common platform used widely by individual to express their opinions and sentiments on various events. Twitter sentiment analysis basically deals with the analysis of twitter quotes to find the hidden pattern in the sentiments expressed by the users in past.

Conventional approaches, such as Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), rely on large datasets and centralized processing, making them impractical for federated learning due to privacy and computational constraints. This study introduces Federated Mamba-MoE, a novel framework that integrates Federated learning (FL) with Mixture of Experts (MoE) to enable efficient cross-domain adaptation without requiring data centralization. The proposed architecture leverages adaptive expert routing, selective expert activation, and adaptive feature fusion, ensuring improved domain generalization while preserving privacy. Comprehensive evaluations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image classification benchmarks demonstrate 91.6% accuracy, 85.4% F1-score, privacy loss ϵ<1.0, computational efficiency of 5 ms/epoch/client, and minimal communication overhead (2 MB/round). The results highlight the model's superiority in addressing domain heterogeneity while maintaining privacy, making it a robust solution for decentralized machine learning applications in privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare and internet of things (IoT). Emphasize that Federated Mamba-MoE uniquely integrates adaptive expert routing with multi-layer domain-specific feature fusion and dynamic privacy-aware optimization.}

abstract = {The alarming growth of misinformation on social media has become a global concern as it influences public opinions and compromises social, political, and public health development. The proliferation of deceptive information has resulted in widespread confusion, societal disturbances, and significant consequences for matters pertaining to health. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a substantial surge in the dissemination of inaccurate or deceptive information via social media platforms, particularly X (formerly known as Twitter), resulting in the phenomenon commonly referred to as an “Infodemic”. This review paper examines a grand selection of 600 articles published in the past five years and focuses on conducting a thorough analysis of 87 studies that investigate the detection of fake news connected to COVID-19 on Twitter. In addition, this research explores the algorithmic techniques and methodologies used to investigate the individuals responsible for disseminating this type of fake news. A summary of common datasets, along with their fundamental qualities, for detecting fake news has been included as well. For the purpose of identifying fake news, the behavioral pattern of the misinformation spreaders, and their community analysis, we have performed an in-depth examination of the most recent literature that the researchers have worked with and recommended. Our key findings can be summarized in a few points: (a) around 80% of fake news detection-related papers have utilized Deep Neural Networks-based techniques for better performance achievement, although the proposed models suffer from overfitting, vanishing gradients, and higher prediction time problems, (b) around 60% of the disseminator related analysis papers focus on identifying dominant spreaders and their communities utilizing graph modeling although there is not much work done in this domain, and finally, (c) we conclude by pointing out a wide range of research gaps, for example, the need of a large and robust training dataset and deeper investigation of the communities, etc., and suggesting potential solution strategies. Moreover, to facilitate the utilization of a large training dataset for detecting fake news, we have created a large database by compiling the training datasets from 17 different research works. The objective of this study is to shed light on exactly how COVID-19-related tweets are beginning to diverge, along with the dissemination of misinformation. Our work uncovers notable discoveries, including the ongoing rapid growth of the disseminator population, the presence of professional spreaders within the disseminator community, and a substantial level of collaboration among the fake news spreaders.}

Most existing methods rely on supervised learning approaches using labeled data. However, the retrieval of such labeled training data is difficult and expensive, especially for new domains and/or languages. This work focuses on simultaneously detecting aspect categories and sentiment polarities for a given sentence in a weakly-supervised setting. Two methods are proposed that combine an unsupervised labeling algorithm with a neural network architecture. The first proposed two-step model (SB-ASC) takes seed sentences as input for the labeling algorithm. By leveraging the power of pre-trained Sentence-BERT embeddings, the method is able to understand the contextual meaning of sentences to create a high-quality labeled dataset. This dataset is used by a class imbalance-robust BERT-based neural network that jointly learns latent features of aspect categories and the corresponding sentiment. The second proposed method (WB-ASC) uses the same neural network structure but takes seed words instead of seed sentences as input for the labeling algorithm. We conclude that SB-ASC outperforms WB-ASC as well as baselines and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods for aspect sentiment detection, achieving F1 scores for aspect category detection of 71.35%, 86.99%, and 73.86%, and F1 scores for sentiment classification of 89.24%, 89.98%, and 75.58% for the SemEval 2016 restaurant-5, restaurant-3, and laptop datasets, respectively.

We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps. Finally, this survey details the constraints that challenge grooming detection, unaddressed problems, and possible future solutions to improve the state-of-the-art and make the algorithms more reliable.}

Using this data, we show that all existing sentiment models trained on adjacent domains struggle with accurate market sentiment analysis due to the task’s specialized vocabulary. Consequently, we design, train, and deploy our own sentiment model. It outperforms all previous models (VADER, NTUSD-Fin, FinBERT, TwitterRoBERTa) when evaluated on Twitter posts. On posts from a different platform, our model performs on par with BERT-based large language models.

The abstractive summarization model goes through two finetuning stages, the first one, for domain adaptation and the second one, for final task learning. Several studies in the literature empirically demonstrate that review rating has a positive correlation with sentiment valence. For the sentiment classification framework, we used the rating value as a signal to determine the review sentiment, and the model is built on top of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) architecture. We evaluated our models comprehensively with multiple metrics. Our results indicate competitive performance of the models in terms of most of the evaluation metrics.}

However, traditional emotion recognition approaches often struggle in few-shot cross-domain scenarios due to their limited capacity to generalize semantic features across different domains. Additionally, these methods face challenges in accurately capturing complex emotional states, particularly those that are subtle or implicit. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach called Dual-Task Contrastive Meta-Learning (DTCML). This method combines meta-learning and contrastive learning to improve emotion recognition. Meta-learning enhances the model’s ability to generalize to new emotional tasks, while instance contrastive learning further refines the model by distinguishing unique features within each category, enabling it to better differentiate complex emotional expressions. Prototype contrastive learning, in turn, helps the model address the semantic complexity of emotions across different domains, enabling the model to learn fine-grained emotions expression. By leveraging dual tasks, DTCML learns from two domains simultaneously, the model is encouraged to learn more diverse and generalizable emotions features, thereby improving its cross-domain adaptability and robustness, and enhancing its generalization ability. We evaluated the performance of DTCML across four cross-domain settings, and the results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.88%, 12.04%, 8.49%, and 8.40% in terms of accuracy.}

abstract = {Purpose
Because of the expansion of the internet and Web 2.0 phenomenon, new challenges are emerging in the disclosure practises adopted by organisations in the public-sector. This study aims to examine local governments’ (LGOs) use of social media (SM) in disclosing environmental actions/plans/information as a new way to improve accountability to citizens to obtain organisational legitimacy and the related sentiment of citizens’ judgements.
Design/methodology/approach
This paper analyses the content of 39 Italian LGOs’ public pages on Facebook. After the distinction between five classes of environmental issues (air, water, energy, waste and territory), an initial study is performed to detect possible sub-topics applying latent Dirichlet allocation. Having a list of posts related to specific environmental themes, the researchers computed the sentiment of citizens’ comments. To measure sentiment, two different approaches were implemented: one based on a lexicon dictionary and the other based on convolutional neural networks.
Findings
Facebook is used by LGOs to disclose environmental issues, focussing on their main interest in obtaining organisational legitimacy, and the analysis shows an increasing impact of Web 2.0 in the direct interaction of LGOs with citizens. On the other hand, there is a clear divergence of interest on environmental topics between LGOs and citizens in a dialogic accountability framework.
Practical implications
Sentiment analysis (SA) could be used by politicians, but also by managers/entrepreneurs in the business sector, to analyse stakeholders’ judgements of their communications/actions and plans on corporate social responsibility. This tool gives a result on time (i.e. not months or years after, as for the reporting system). It is cheaper than a survey and allows a first “photograph” of stakeholders’ sentiment. It can also be a useful tool for supporting, developing and improving environmental reporting.
Originality/value
To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first to apply SA to environmental disclosure via SM in the public sphere. The study links modern techniques in natural language processing and machine learning with the important aspects of environmental communication between LGOs and citizens.}

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fine-grained process. Its fundamental subtasks are aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity classification (APC), and these subtasks are dependent and closely related. However, most existing works on Arabic ABSA content separately address them, assume that aspect terms are preidentified, or use a pipeline model. Pipeline solutions design different models for each task, and the output from the ATE model is used as the input to the APC model, which may result in error propagation among different steps because APC is affected by ATE error. These methods are impractical for real-world scenarios where the ATE task is the base task for APC, and its result impacts the accuracy of APC. Thus, in this study, we focused on a multi-task learning model for Arabic ATE and APC in which the model is jointly trained on two subtasks simultaneously in a single model. This paper integrates the multi-task model, namely Local Cotext Foucse-Aspect Term Extraction and Polarity classification (LCF-ATEPC) and Arabic Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (AraBERT) as a shred layer for Arabic contextual text representation. The LCF-ATEPC model is based on a multi-head self-attention and local context focus mechanism (LCF) to capture the interactive information between an aspect and its context. Moreover, data augmentation techniques are proposed based on state-of-the-art augmentation techniques (word embedding substitution with constraints and contextual embedding (AraBERT)) to increase the diversity of the training dataset. This paper examined the effect of data augmentation on the multi-task model for Arabic ABSA. Extensive experiments were conducted on the original and combined datasets (merging the original and augmented datasets). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-task model outperformed existing APC techniques. Superior results were obtained by AraBERT and LCF-ATEPC with fusion layer (AR-LCF-ATEPC-Fusion) and the proposed data augmentation word embedding-based method (FastText) on the combined dataset.}

To reduce the spread of fake information, there is a need to detect the fake/false information being posted on social media apps like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and many. In order to identify false news, researchers employ models based on machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning. These models are to be trained initially by huge amounts of data so that the models can gain knowledge from the trained data and predict the output for the new data provided. This study performs a detailed systematic review on different recent federated learning models being proposed for detecting fake news. It provides a detailed comparison of recently published articles related to fake-news detection using federated learning in terms of models they used.

In this study, we propose a modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection for sentiment analysis. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of sentiment classification by selecting the most informative features and utilizing an optimized boosting algorithm. The proposed algorithm leverages the strength of the Bayesian framework and boosting techniques to handle the challenges of sentiment analysis effectively. It incorporates a feature selection mechanism that assigns weights to individual features based on their importance in sentiment classification. This weight-guided feature selection approach helps identify the most relevant and discriminative features, enhancing classification performance. The algorithm employs a modified Bayesian boosting algorithm to optimize the boosting process. It dynamically adjusts the weights assigned to weak classifiers during the boosting iterations, emphasizing the misclassified instances and providing more focused learning for accurate sentiment prediction. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on a benchmark sentiment analysis dataset, comparing it with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection achieves superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The algorithm shows its effectiveness in capturing the sentiment patterns and improving the overall sentiment classification performance. The results demonstrated that the proposed model had gained an accuracy level of 98.49%, even the Random Forest algorithm gained an accuracy level of 78.6%, and the C4.5 model achieved an accuracy level of 68.58% individually. The proposed modified Bayesian Boosting algorithm with weight-guided optimal feature selection presents a promising approach for sentiment analysis. It effectively addresses the challenges of feature selection and boosting, leading to improved sentiment classification accuracy. The algorithm’s ability to adjust weights and select informative features adaptively enhances its sentiment analysis tasks performance. This research opens up new avenues for advancing sentiment analysis techniques and contributes to developing more accurate and efficient sentiment analysis models.}

abstract = {Sarcasm detection in Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly important, particularly with the rise of social media and non-textual emotional expressions, such as images. Existing methods often rely on separate image and text modalities, which may not fully utilize the information available from both sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal large model, i.e., the PKME-MLM (Prior Knowledge and Multi-label Emotion analysis based Multimodal Large Model for sarcasm detection). The PKME-MLM aims to enhance sarcasm detection by integrating prior knowledge to extract useful textual information from images, which is then combined with text data for deeper analysis. This method improves the integration of image and text data, addressing the limitation of previous models that process these modalities separately. Additionally, we incorporate multi-label sentiment analysis, refining sentiment labels to improve sarcasm recognition accuracy. This design overcomes the limitations of prior models that treated sentiment classification as a single-label problem, thereby improving sarcasm recognition by distinguishing subtle emotional cues from the text. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in multimodal sarcasm detection tasks, with an accuracy (Acc.) of 94.35%, and Macro-Average Precision and Recall reaching 93.92% and 94.21%, respectively. These results highlight the potential of multimodal models in improving sarcasm detection and suggest that further integration of modalities could advance future research. This work also paves the way for incorporating multimodal sentiment analysis into sarcasm detection.}

Misleading news detection has become a global topic of interest due to its significant impact on society, economics, and politics. Automatic detection of the veracity of news remains challenging because of its diversity and close resemblance with true events. In many languages, fake news detection has been studied from different perspectives. However, in Bangla, existing endeavors on fake news detection generally relied on linguistic style analysis and latent representation-based machine learning and deep learning models. These models primarily rely on manually labeled annotations. To address these challenges, we proposed a knowledge-based Bangla fake news detection model that does not require model training. In our proposed manipulation detection approach, a news article is automatically labeled as fake or authentic based on an authenticity score that relies on the consistency of knowledge and semantics, underlying sentiment, and credibility of the news source. We also propose a consistent and context-aware manipulated news generation technique to facilitate the detection of partially manipulated Bangla news. We found the proposed model to be a reliable one for the detection of both fake news and partially manipulated news. We also developed a dataset that is balanced according to the number of authentic and fake news for the detection of Bangla fake news, where news items are collected from multiple domains and various news sources. The experimental evaluation of our proposed knowledge-driven approach on the developed dataset has shown 97.08% accuracy for only fake news detection.}

GCL can overcome difficulties with lengthy sequence training samples, extracting the optimal features that help improve Arabic sentiment analysis performance for binary and multiple classifications. The proposed method trains and tests in various Arabic datasets; The results are better than the baselines in all cases. GCL includes a Custom Regularization Function (CRF), which improves the performance and optimizes the validation loss. We carry out an ablation study and investigate the effect of removing CRF. CRF is shown to make a difference of up to 5.10% (2C) and 4.12% (3C). Furthermore, we study the relationship between Modern Standard Arabic and five Arabic dialects via a cross-dialect training study. Finally, we apply GCL through standard regularization (GCL+L1, GCL+L2, and GCL+LElasticNet) and our Lnew on two big Arabic sentiment datasets; GCL+Lnew gave the highest results (92.53%) with less performance time.}

The traditional supervised models have achieved promising results with annotated datasets. However, their performance dramatically decreases in cross-domain aspect term extraction tasks. Existing cross-domain transfer learning methods face two common limitations: (1) these works directly inject linguistic features into language models, making it challenging to transfer linguistic knowledge to the target domain; (2) they rely on the fixed predefined prompts, which is time-consuming to construct the prompts for all potential aspect term spans. To address the limitations, we propose a soft prompt-based joint learning method for cross-domain aspect term extraction in this paper. Specifically, by incorporating external linguistic features, the proposed method learns domain-invariant representations between source and target domains via multiple objectives, which bridges the gap between domains with varied distributions of aspect terms. Furthermore, the proposed method interpolates a set of transferable soft prompts consisting of multiple learnable vectors that are beneficial to detect aspect terms in the target domain. Extensive experiments are conducted on two groups of datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for cross-domain aspect terms extraction.}

Therefore, this study proposes a knowledge-enhanced pre-trained language model for text sentiment analysis. The model effectively improves the model's ability to understand emotional semantics by integrating external knowledge bases, such as emotional dictionaries and domain-specific knowledge. In the pre-training stage, we adopted a large-scale Chinese text dataset and combined emotional labels for joint training. The experimental results show that compared with the baseline model, the accuracy of the proposed model in the sentiment classification task is improved by 8.3 %, and the F1 score is improved by 7.5 %. The model performed equally well in the fine-grained sentiment analysis task, with accuracy and F1 scores improving by 6.2 % and 5.8 %, respectively. In addition, the model shows stronger robustness when dealing with long texts and complex emotional expressions. Further analysis shows that the knowledge enhancement module effectively improves the model's ability to recognize emotional vocabulary and tendencies. This study provides a new technical path for text sentiment analysis and a valuable exploration for applying pre-trained language models in specific fields.}

Crop yields are affected at large scale due to the spread of unchecked diseases. The spread of these diseases is similar to the spreading of cancer in the human body. But, unlike cancer, these diseases can be identified at early stages through plant phenotyping traits analysis. In order to effectively identify these diseases, effective segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification processes must be followed. Selection of the best combination for the given methods is very complex due to the presence of a large number of the aforementioned methods. Thereby, disease prediction models are generally found to be ineffective. This paper proposes a highly effective machine learning-based formulation approach to select a proper classification process that improves the overall accuracy of crop disease detection with different dimensionalities of plant datasets and includes maximum features. Hence, the proposed adaptive learning algorithm gives 99.2% accuracy compared to other techniques like back-propagation neural network (BPNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and SVM.}

Until now, sentiment analysis has proven to be an effective tool for determining the overall polarity of reviews. To improve the granularity at the aspect level for a better understanding of the service or product, the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to first identify aspects and then determine the user’s opinion about them. The complexity of this task lies in the fact that the same review can present multiple aspects, each with its own polarity. Current solutions have poor performance on such data. We address this problem by proposing ATESA-BÆRT, a heterogeneous ensemble learning model for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. Firstly, we divide our problem into two sub-tasks, i.e., Aspect Term Extraction and Aspect Term Sentiment Analysis. Secondly, we use the argmax multi-class classification on six transformers-based learners for each sub-task. The proposed ensemble integrates representations from pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT and BART models in order to capture diverse linguistic features. By combining these with Linear, BiLSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM models, we aim to achieve enhanced performance on the aspect-based sentiment analysis task. Initial experiments on two publicly available real-world English online review datasets prove that ATESA-BÆRT outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions while tackling the sentiment analysis many aspects problem.}

However, labeled data are usually expensive to obtain, thus, not always achievable. When annotated data are unavailable, the unsupervised tools are exercised, which still lag behind the performance of supervised ML methods by a large margin. Therefore, in this work, we focus on improving the performance of sentiment classification from unlabeled data. We present a self-supervised hybrid methodology SSentiA (Self-supervised Sentiment Analyzer) that couples an ML classifier with a lexicon-based method for sentiment classification from unlabeled data. We first introduce LRSentiA (Lexical Rule-based Sentiment Analyzer), a lexicon-based method to predict the semantic orientation of a review along with the confidence score of prediction. Utilizing the confidence scores of LRSentiA, we generate highly accurate pseudo-labels for SSentiA that incorporates a supervised ML algorithm to improve the performance of sentiment classification for less polarized and complex reviews. We compare the performances of LRSentiA and SSSentA with the existing unsupervised, lexicon-based and self-supervised methods in multiple datasets. The LRSentiA performs similarly to the existing lexicon-based methods in both binary and 3-class sentiment analysis. By combining LRSentiA with an ML classifier, the hybrid approach SSentiA attains 10%–30% improvements in macro F1 score for both binary and 3-class sentiment analysis. The results suggest that in domains where annotated data are unavailable, SSentiA can significantly improve the performance of sentiment classification. Moreover, we demonstrate that using 30%–60% annotated training data, SSentiA delivers similar performances of the fully labeled training dataset.}

Although certain ABSA techniques employ syntactic information to capture the connection between the opinion target and the sentiment word, they often do not incorporate data processing techniques such as dependency parsing, which can be beneficial in accurately capturing the sentiment expressed towards the opinion target. In this paper a method for ABSA that employs both syntax and semantic information and incorporates dependency parsing(Semantic-Syntactic Dependency Parsing (SSDP) Method) with Core Natural Language Processing (CoreNLP) which is a natural language processing library for processing the input text and identifying patterns effectively (according to the CoreNLP relations and part of speech tagging(POS)) to extract the critical relations that accurately reflect the sentiment conveyed regarding the opinion target is proposed. The results show that the proposed pattern captured approximately 75% of the data, and the rest were classified via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based on semantic information. We illustrated the efficacy of SSDP, through experiments on the SemEval14,Semval15 and Semval16 datasets, which include two datasets (laptops and restaurants) carefully categorized by a human annotator into categories of positive, negative, or neutral attitudes. The experimental results reveal that SSDP is superior to the other state-of-the-art ABSA approaches, that use syntax information but do not utilize data processing techniques. Additionally, we highlight the limitations of ABSA methods that do not incorporate syntax information and the potential improvements that can be made through the use of data processing.}

abstract = {Fake reviews in e-commerce can lead to customer deception and financial losses. Despite the importance of fake reviews detection, studies for Arabic language are scarce due to the lack of comprehensive datasets. This study addresses this gap by introducing a full-gold standard dataset, the Arabic Fake Reviews Detection (AFRD), across hotels, restaurants, and product domains. To identify the most effective model for each domain in the context of fake review detection, this research employed Bi-LSTM, Bi-GRU, CNN+Bi-LSTM, and CNN+Bi-GRU models. These models were then used in a cascading approach called Multiscale Cascaded domain-based (MCDB), which transfers knowledge from one domain to enhance results in other domains. Experimental results demonstrated that the MCDB approach improved the results of the models by 2.09% to 7.8% in terms of accuracy. The introduced dataset can be used to build effective models for Arabic e-commerce platforms, in addition to further Natural Language Processing applications. This study demonstrates that leveraging domain-specific datasets in a cascading manner can significantly improve performance, holding substantial implications for future research in problems with limited-size datasets.}

In this work, the clause boundary, discourse argument, and syntactic and semantic information of the sentence are used to assign the text’s sentiment. The clause boundaries identify the span of the text, and the discourse connectives identify the arguments. Since the lexicon-based analysis of traditional sentiment analysis gives the wrong sentiment of the sentence, a deeper-level semantic analysis is required for the correct analysis of sentiments. Hence, in this study, explicit connectives in Malayalam are considered to identify the discourse arguments. A supervised method, conditional random fields, is used to identify the clause boundary and discourse arguments. For the study, 1,000 sentiment sentences from Malayalam documents were analyzed. Experimental results show that the discourse structure integration considerably improves sentiment analysis performance from the baseline system.}

Analysis of such material where more than one person is involved has a spate challenge as compared to other text analysis tasks. There are several approaches to identify users’ emotions from the conversational text for the English language, however regional or low resource languages have been neglected. The Urdu language is one of them and despite being used by millions of users across the globe, with the best of our knowledge there exists no work on dialogue analysis in the Urdu language. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a model which utilizes deep learning and machine learning approaches for the classification of users’ emotions from the text. To accomplish this task, we have first created a dataset for the Urdu language with the help of existing English language datasets for dialogue analysis. After that, we have preprocessed the data and selected dialogues with common emotions. Once the dataset is prepared, we have used different deep learning and machine learning techniques for the classification of emotion. We have tuned the algorithms according to the Urdu language datasets. The experimental evaluation has shown encouraging results with 67% accuracy for the Urdu dialogue datasets, more than 10, 000 dialogues are classified into five emotions i.e., joy, fear, anger, sadness, and neutral. We believe that this is the first effort for emotion detection from the conversational text in the Urdu language domain.}

While advances in data science undeniably hold the key to accurately detecting and curtailing the unfettered spread of fake news, guidance on the selection of algorithms and models that are best suited to a specific fake news scenario leaves much to be desired. Most studies have focused on fake news in a specific domain and employed a limited range of algorithmic techniques. In contrast, the thematic diversity of fake news raises questions over the comprehensiveness of such techniques, whose performance drops when exposed to fake news from a different domain. The current study responds to this call for guidance by focusing on thematically diverse datasets, applying a series of complex algorithms, and performing topic modeling on them. The results demonstrate that ensemble techniques outperform other algorithms, achieving high levels of accuracy of over 98 percent and 95 percent on thematically diverse and pandemic-related datasets, respectively. The study also demonstrates that neural networks are not a panacea for all situations, while topic modeling helps illustrate the lack of coherence in fake news articles. The study offers a distinct perspective on the accuracy of a diverse set of algorithmic approaches and their ability to adapt to an ever-evolving multi-domain world of fake news. A key implication of the study is the unique and comprehensive view of classification performance when exposed to diverse datasets, including pandemic-related news and data from other disciplines, as opposed to its performance on pandemic-related data alone. Our practical contribution is truly the comparative perspective we offer to practitioners when a choice of algorithm is to be made to accurately detect fake news with thematic heterogeneity.}

However, the abundance of reviews and the risk of encountering spoilers pose challenges for efficient sentiment analysis, particularly in Arabic content. This study proposed a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) machine learning (ML) model tailored for sentiment analysis in Arabic and English movie reviews. SGD allows for flexible model complexity adjustments, which can adapt well to the Involvement of Arabic language data. This adaptability ensures that the model can capture the nuances and specific local patterns of Arabic text, leading to better performance. Two distinct language datasets were utilized, and extensive pre-processing steps were employed to optimize the datasets for analysis. The proposed SGD model, designed to accommodate the nuances of each language, aims to surpass existing models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The SGD model achieves an accuracy of 84.89 on the Arabic dataset and 87.44 on the English dataset, making it the top-performing model in terms of accuracy on both datasets. This indicates that the SGD model consistently demonstrates high accuracy levels across Arabic and English datasets. This study helps deepen the understanding of sentiments across various linguistic datasets. Unlike many studies that focus solely on movie reviews, the Arabic dataset utilized here includes hotel reviews, offering a broader perspective.}

They're also important for future customers to understand previous customers' experiences. Sentimental Analysis (SA) identifies patterns of sentiment in reviews by analyzing and extracting opinions from websites, papers, blogs, and other sources. The customer finds it difficult to locate a review for a specific aspect of a product they intend to purchase. Since it is difficult to go through a huge number of reviews, feature selection is used to reduce the data's dimensionality. Because choosing an appropriate feature can identify the product attributes that are disliked or discussed by consumers, selecting a feature is a significant step in sentiment analysis. In this paper, a Pearson correlation coefficient-based Harris Hawks Optimization – based Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (PCCHHO-RNN-LSTM) algorithm is proposed to select features from reviews given by users for classifying their sentiments according to their appropriate polarity. In this proposed PCCHHO-RNNLSTM, to achieve greater accuracy, the correlation coefficients of features are used to conduct an initial dimensionality reduction. The HHO algorithm is then used to choose a small group of non-redundant features and RNN-LSTM is used to classify sentiments to their suitable polarity. The proposed method has been evaluated using the data gathered from Amazon. com's online product reviews. MATLAB software is used to implement the proposed work. From experimental results, the proposed PCCHH-RNNLSTM demonstrates considerable improvements of 95.8% accuracy, 95.4% precision, 95.6% recall, and 95.2% F-measure, respectively.}

The availability of annotated datasets is limited, and preprocessing of the noisy content is even more challenging, sometimes resulting in the removal of important cues of sentiment from the input. To overcome such problems, this study investigates the applicability of using transfer learning based on pre-trained transformer models to classify sentiment in Arabic texts with high accuracy. Specifically, it uses the CAMeLBERT model finetuned for the Multi-Domain Arabic Resources for Sentiment Analysis (MARSA) dataset containing more than 56,000 manually annotated tweets annotated across political, social, sports, and technology domains. The proposed method avoids extensive use of preprocessing and shows that raw data provides better results because they tend to retain more linguistic features. The fine-tuned CAMeLBERT model produces state-of-the-art accuracy of 92%, precision of 91.7%, recall of 92.3%, and F1-score of 91.5%, outperforming standard machine learning models and ensemble-based/deep learning techniques. Our performance comparisons against other pre-trained models, namely AraBERTv02-twitter and MARBERT, show that transformer-based architectures are consistently the best suited when dealing with noisy Arabic texts. This work leads to a strong remedy for the problems in Arabic sentiment analysis and provides recommendations on easy tuning of the pre-trained models to adapt to challenging linguistic features and domain-specific tasks.}

Due to the ubiquitous real-time data availability, many rescue agencies monitor this data regularly to identify disasters, reduce risk, and save lives. However, it is impossible for humans to manually check the mass amount of data and identify disasters in real-time. For this purpose, many research have been proposed to present words in machine-understandable representations and apply machine learning methods on the word representations to identify the sentiment of a text. The previous research methods provide a single vector representation or embedding of a word from a given document. However, the recent advanced contextual embedding method (BERT — Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) constructs different vectors for the same word in different contexts. The BERT embeddings have been used successfully in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, yet there is no concrete analysis of how these representations are helpful in disaster-type tweet analysis. This research study explores the efficacy of the BERT embeddings on predicting disaster from Twitter data and compares these to traditional context-free word embedding methods. We provide both quantitative and qualitative results for this study. The results show that the contextual embeddings have the best results in disaster prediction task than the traditional word embeddings. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of contextual embeddings on sentiment analysis of Twitter data.}

abstract = {The rapid growth of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications has gained interest in various languages, including Arabic. One critical NLP task is Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). ABSA involves identifying the sentiment expressed toward specific aspects or attributes of entities mentioned in a piece of text, rather than determining the overall sentiment. Despite the increased use of Semitic languages like Arabic in NLP over the past decade, there remains a lack of resources and datasets in Arabic, particularly in dialectical Arabic. Additionally, existing ABSA datasets are often limited to a single domain, which does not support all types of ABSA, such as multi-domain ABSA, nor do they allow for testing a model's generalization capabilities. This study addresses these limitations by constructing multi-domain ABSA datasets in Arabic for the tasks of aspect extraction and aspect polarity detection. The datasets include both real and synthetic data, covering dialectical and modern standard Arabic, and comprising 6,500 records across five domains. These datasets can be utilized in single-domain, cross-domain, and multi-domain experiments for ABSA. Furthermore, we evaluated the constructed datasets using various transformer-based models and assessed the impact of generating synthetic data on the diversity and balance of the data, as well as on model performance. The results reported in this research demonstrate that the data is valid for use in ABSA tasks. Moreover, the models used for evaluation achieved competitive or superior results compared to existing models on various datasets. Additionally, the annotation guidelines we created are presented as recommended practices applicable to different tasks. All datasets used in this study are publicly available for research purposes.}

abstract = {Most consumers read online reviews written by different users before making purchase decisions, where each opinion expresses some sentiment. Therefore, sentiment analysis is currently a hot topic of research. In particular, aspect-based sentiment analysis concerns the exploration of emotions, opinions and facts that are expressed by people, usually in the form of polarity. It is crucial to consider polarity calculations and not simply categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral. Currently, the available lexicon-based method accuracy is affected by limited coverage. Several of the available polarity estimation techniques are too general and may not reflect the aspect/topic in question if reviews contain a wide range of information about different topics. This paper presents a model for the polarity estimation of customer reviews using aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA-PER). ABSA-PER has three major phases: data preprocessing, aspect co-occurrence calculation (CAC) and polarity estimation. A multi-domain sentiment dataset, Twitter dataset, and trust pilot forum dataset (developed by us by defined judgement rules) are used to verify ABSA-PER. Experimental outcomes show that ABSA-PER achieves better accuracy, i.e., 85.7% accuracy for aspect extraction and 86.5% accuracy in terms of polarity estimation, than that of the baseline methods.}

The study explores key questions surrounding sentiment analysis within educational data. Initially, we design an index system and determine evaluation based an online questionnaires framework for OTICE, while simultaneously compiling online data for corpus development. Subsequently, we create the Multi-Module Architecture Driven Model (MMADM), which integrates a 3D-CNN module, a gated mechanism, and a selection module. Across all evaluated setups, combining a gated mechanism with Bag of Words (BoW) and a Word2Vector (W2V) word-embedding model based on the skip-gram approach delivers the highest predictive performance. Empirical findings confirm that deep learning models outperform ensemble learning techniques in the context of educational data mining. Moreover, comparative model analysis reveals that the 3D-CNN module paired with the gated mechanism produces optimal results, achieving precision (P) and F1 scores of 97.91% and 97.90%, respectively. Compared to other models, the overall performance improves by 3% to 5%.

Despite being a worldwide issue, the majority of detection systems in place concentrate mostly on English. Although Arabic is the fifth most spoken language worldwide,it is a vulnerable target and remains underrepresented in phishing research. To address this gap, this study introduces a large Arabic phishing email dataset and develops a range of machine learning-based models, employing both individual and ensemble techniques. The classifiers include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, and AdaBoost. Additionally, ensemble methods – namely full and binary stacking – are utilized to enhance performance. The models were assessed using standard metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and F1-score. It was determined that individual classifiers such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression reached outstanding accuracies of 95.23%, and 97.12%, respectively. In addition, ensemble approaches further improved performance, with the Naive Bayes–AdaBoost combination reaching 97.01%, and the full stacking meta-classifier achieving 98.24%. To validate real-world cases, we conducted cross-domain evaluations using an English–Arabic phishing dataset. In response to the evolving forms of phishing that pose challenges to traditional detection methods, we perform a detailed linguistic analysis, specifically focusing on deceptive language patterns found in phishing emails. These findings can be leveraged to develop models with a wider range of applications beyond phishing detection systems.}

abstract = {The exponential growth of digital information, particularly user-generated content on social media and blogging platforms, has underscored the importance of sentiment analysis (SA). Arabic language sentiment analysis (ASA) involves identifying the orientation of ideas, feelings, emotions, and attitudes within Arabic text to determine whether they convey a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the past decade, focusing on the utilization of SA in the Arabic language. It examines various applications, methodologies, and challenges associated with ASA, highlighting gaps and limitations in existing approaches, lexicons, and annotated datasets. The primary objective of this review is to assist researchers in identifying these gaps and limitations while offering accessible annotated datasets, preprocessing techniques, and procedures. We defined specific criteria for selecting research publications from the last 10 years, including 150 papers in our review process, while excluding earlier publications. The review utilized multiple databases, including Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. The inherent complexity of the Arabic language, due to its unique traits and diverse dialects, presents significant challenges in ASA. Moreover, the lack of annotated datasets, lexicon resources, and programming tools further complicates sentiment analysis in Arabic. The morphological variations within Arabic make it linguistically challenging. To address these issues, it is crucial to develop additional resources and construct new Arabic sentiment lexicons that account for the various dialects within Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Our findings reveal that there is no standard public lexicon that adequately enhances the calculation of ASA across different domains, such as e-commerce, politics, public health, and marketing.}

Various sub-tasks have been defined according to different scenarios, extracting aspect terms, opinion terms, and the corresponding sentiment. However, most existing studies merely focus on a specific sub-task or a subset of sub-tasks, having many complicated models designed and developed. This hinders the practical applications of aspect-based sentiment analysis. Therefore, some unified frameworks are proposed to handle all the subtasks, but most of them suffer from two limitations. First, the syntactic features are neglected, but such features have been proven effective for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Second, very few efficient mechanisms are developed to leverage important syntactic features, e.g., dependency relations, dependency relation types, and part-of-speech tags. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel unified framework to handle all defined sub-tasks for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Specifically, based on the graph convolutional network, a multi-layer semantic model is designed to capture the semantic relations between aspect and opinion terms. Moreover, a multi-layer syntax model is proposed to learn explicit dependency relations from different layers. To facilitate the sub-tasks, the learned semantic features are propagated to the syntax model with better semantic guidance to learn the syntactic representations comprehensively. Different from the conventional syntactic model, the proposed framework introduces two attention mechanisms. One is to model dependency relation and type, and the other is to encode part-of-speech tags for detecting aspect and opinion term boundaries. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed novel unified framework, and the experimental results on four groups of real-world datasets explicitly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework over a range of baselines.}

Initially, suggestion mining utilized manually crafted features, but recent advancements have highlighted the efficacy of deep learning models, which automatically learn features. Models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) have been employed in this field.

Emotion recognition based on electroencephalogram (EEG) has attracted extensive attention in the fields of human-computer interaction and psychological healthcare. However, the redundancy of EEG signals poses a challenge to emotion recognition. Therefore, linking feature selection in EEG-based emotion recognition with specific brain regions holds great promise for solving cross-domain transfer EEG emotion recognition. In this study, we proposed a novel manifold sorting feature selection (MSFS) method, and its corresponding multi-source classification framework. MSFS selects channel features most similar to the T7 and T8 channels, which are highly related to each emotion category, using effective manifold-based similarity ranking. The selected features are combined and used for prediction and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the average accuracy of the MSFS method combined with SVM on the SEED, and SEED-IV is 77.63%, and 53.65%, which are 1.26%, and 2.90% higher than the SVM without MSFS. Furthermore, the performance of MSFS is compared with other advanced feature selection methods, which proves the superiority of our method.}

There is an increase in the development of social media and electronic commerce sites day by day. In order to express their opinions about the products purchased user's write comments, messages and reviews. The reviews present in the e-commerce sites are also increasing. Users find difficulty in getting appropriate information about the right topic from this large data. Aspect-based Opinion Mining (ABOM) helps users in this regard. In many real-world applications ABOM is used to get the details about the aspects of entities, where the opinion is expressed for those aspects and entities. One of the key elements of ABOM is Aspect extraction. Unsupervised Machine Learning approach has been used to extract aspects from the reviews as it does not require pre-labelled data. In this regard Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) are two most commonly used unsupervised Topic Modeling approaches. The topics are extracted from three different datasets such as Amazon Mobile Reviews, Hotel Reviews and IMDb Movie Reviews using LDA and LSA algorithms. These extracted topics are aspects of our interest. The results of topic modeling algorithms are quite difficult to be interpreted by the common user. The different visualization methods are used to display the results of topic modeling algorithms in an interactive way. Two different multi-class classifiers such as Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been constructed for aspect categorization. These classifiers are evaluated by considering the evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall and F1 score. As a result, SVM classifier has good performance than MNB classifier for aspect categorization task of aspect-based opinion mining.}

abstract = {The interest in social media sentiment analysis and opinion mining for public security events has increased over the years. The availability of social media platforms for communication provides a valuable source of information for sentiment analysis and opinion mining research. The content shared across the media gives potential input to the physical environment and social phenomena related to public security threats. The input has been used to: monitor public security threats or emergency events, analyzing sentiment and opinionated data for threat management and the detection of public security threat events using geographic location-based sentiment analysis. However, a systematic survey that describes the trends and latest developments in this domain is unavailable. This paper presents a survey of social media sentiment analysis and opinion mining for public security. This paper aims to: understand the progress of the current state-of-the-art, identify the research gaps, and propose potential future directions. In total, 200 articles published from 2016 to 2023 were considered in this survey. The taxonomy shows the key attributes and limitations of the work presented in the surveyed articles. Subsequently, the potential future direction of work on sentiment analysis in the public security domain is suggested for interested researchers.}

The lack of sufficient resources is considered to be an important challenge for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of the Bangla language. The ABSA is a technique that divides the text and defines its sentiment based on its aspects. In this paper, we developed a high-quality Bangla ABSA annotated dataset namely BANGLA_ABSA. The datasets are labelled with aspects category and their respective sentiment polarity to do the ABSA task in Bangla. Four open domains namely Restaurant, Movie, Mobile phone, and Car are considered to make the dataset. The datasets are called Restaurant_ABSA, Movie_ABSA, Mobile_phone_ABSA, and Car_ABSA respectively that contain 801, 800, 975, and 1149 comments. All the comments are either complex or compound sentences. We created the dataset manually and annotated the same by exerting opinions. We organized the dataset as three tuples in Excel format namely 〈Id, Comment, {Aspect category, Sentiment Polarity}〉. These data are very important that facilitate the efficient handling of sentiment for any machine learning and deep learning research, especially for Bangla text.}

abstract = {Sentiment classification tasks, such as emotion detection and sentiment analysis, are essential in modern natural language processing (NLP). Moreover, vector representation frameworks modeling semantic content underlie each state-of-the-art NLP algorithmic scheme. In sentiment classification, traditional methods often rely on such embedding vectors for semantic representation, yet they typically overlook the dynamic and sequential nature of emotions within textual data. In this work, we present a novel methodology that leverages the distributional patterns of emotions. An embedding framework that captures the inherent serial structure of emotional occurrences in text is introduced, modeling the interdependencies between emotion states as they unfold within a document. Our approach treats each sentence as an observation in a multivariate series of emotions, transforming the emotional flow of a text into a sequence of emotion strings. By applying distributional logic, emotion-based embeddings that represent both emotional and semantic information are derived. Through a comprehensive experimental framework, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these embeddings across various sentiment-related tasks, including emotion detection, irony identification, and hate speech classification, evaluated on multiple datasets. The results show that our distributional emotion embeddings significantly enhance the performance of sentiment classification models, offering improved generalization across diverse domains such as financial news and climate change discourse. Hence, this work highlights the potential of using distributional emotion embeddings to advance sentiment analysis, offering a more nuanced understanding of emotional language and its structured, context-dependent manifestations.}

abstract = {Web applications have become central in the digital landscape, providing users instant access to information and allowing businesses to expand their reach. Injection attacks, such as SQL injection (SQLi), are prominent attacks on web applications, given that most web applications integrate a database system. While there have been solutions proposed in the literature for SQLi attack detection using learning-based frameworks, the problem is often formulated as a binary, single-attack vector problem without considering the prioritization and prevention component of the attack. In this work, we propose a holistic solution, SQLR34P3R, that formulates the SQLi attack as a multi-class, multi-attack vector, prioritization, and prevention problem. For attack detection and classification, we gathered 457,233 samples of benign and malicious network traffic, as well as 70,023 samples that had SQLi and benign payloads. After evaluating several machine-learning-based algorithms, the hybrid CNN-LSTM models achieve an average F1-Score of 97% in web and network traffic filtering. Furthermore, by using CVEs of SQLi vulnerabilities, SQLR34P3R incorporates a novel risk analysis approach which reduces additional effort while maintaining reasonable coverage to assist businesses in allocating resources effectively by focusing on patching vulnerabilities with high exploitability. We also present an in-the-wild evaluation of the proposed solution by integrating SQLR34P3R into the pipeline of known vulnerable web applications such as Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) and Vulnado and via network traffic captured using Wireshark from SQLi DNS exfiltration conducted with SQLMap for real-time detection. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art SQLi attack detection and risk ratings solutions.}

This systematic literature review delves into the latest deep learning approaches utilized for CDRS, comprehensively analyzing state-of-the-art techniques, methodologies, metrics, datasets, and applications. We systematically review selected primary studies from popular databases covering sixty-eight publications from 2019 to March 2024. The review process involved selecting relevant studies based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure the inclusion of high-quality research. Key deep learning (DL) models explored include neural collaborative filtering, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, variational autoencoder, and generative adversarial networks. We also examine the hybrid models that integrate DL with traditional machine learning techniques to enhance recommendation performance. Our findings reveal that DL approaches significantly improve accuracy, cold start, and data sparsity. This review also identifies current trends and future research directions, emphasizing the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI), transfer learning, and reinforcement learning in advancing CDRS. In our analysis, we discovered that the domains mainly utilized are movies, books, and music, respectively, and the most widely used evaluation metrics are root mean square error (RMSE) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG). Research challenges and future scope are also highlighted to assist the researchers and practitioners seeking to develop robust cross-domain recommender systems using DL techniques.}

Customer reviews on platforms for online ordering and delivery are a vital source of information about how well a business is performing. Businesses that provide food delivery services (FDS) seek to leverage consumer input to locate areas where customer satisfaction could be raised. Sentiment analysis (SA) has been the subject of an enormous amount of English-language research. Despite Arabic's increasing popularity as a writing language on the Internet, not much study has been conducted on sentiment analysis of Arabic up to this point, with a limited number of publicly available resources for Arabic SA such as datasets and lexicons. The present study collects FDS-related reviews in Arabic to conduct extensive emotion mining, taking advantage of Natural Language Processing, feature selection, and Machine Learning techniques to elicit personal judgments, identify polarity, and recognize customers’ feelings in the FDS domain. To demonstrate that the proposed approach is suitable for analyzing human perceptions of FDS, we designed and carried out excessive experiments that assess the utility of each phase. Our highest categorization accuracy was 90 % using Mutual Information with the SVM classifier. The study's findings provide various managerial insights for improving their plans and service delivery, as well as revealing the main reasons for consumer complaints. It also demonstrates how future academics might harness the power of online business reviews in Arabic using a variety of text-mining approaches.}

Although over 100 counterfactual methods exist in the XAI literature, each claiming to generate plausible explanations akin to those preferred by people, few of these methods have actually been tested on users (∼7%). Even fewer studies adopt a user-centered perspective; for instance, asking people for their counterfactual explanations to determine their perspective on a “good explanation”. This gap in the literature is addressed here using a novel methodology that (i) gathers human-generated counterfactual explanations for misclassified images, in two user studies and, then, (ii) compares these human-generated explanations to computationally-generated explanations for the same misclassifications. Results indicate that humans do not “minimally edit” images when generating counterfactual explanations. Instead, they make larger, “meaningful” edits that better approximate prototypes in the counterfactual class. An analysis based on “explanation goals” is proposed to account for this divergence between human and machine explanations. The implications of these proposals for future work are discussed.}

abstract = {With the development of the offshore fossil energy industry, the designing life of many offshore oil and gas facilities will end. The decommissioning of these facilities has become an urgent task due to unpredictable costs, high risks, and environmental protection issues of public concern. Decision-making, as the core in the pre-decommissioning stage, plays a decisive role in the cost, risk, and impact of the entire decommissioning. Therefore, the multi-attribute decision-making model has attracted much attention from industry and academia. An efficient, accurate, and simply using multi-attribute decision-making model can enable governments, energy companies, other marine users, and environmental protection organizations to reasonably fulfill their concerns. It is of great significance to all parties. This review mainly studies the multi-attribute decision-making models that have been used in the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas facilities, and conducts a more detailed interpretation of them, including the relevant regulations, frameworks, methodology, preferences and advantages and disadvantages of different models. In addition, a more comprehensive review of the cost assessment model, an important part of the decision-making model, is carried out, including the general framework and methodology of the cost assessment model, and the accuracy of the models is explored. And then the current evaluation method of accuracy of the cost assessment model raises the author's personal doubts. At the end of the article, this paper names two core problems of the current decision-making model, that is, the lack of basic data and the incomplete MCDA (Multi-criteria Decision Analysis) method. This review can provide a comprehensive reference and feasible research directions for future scholars who aims to study the decommissioning of offshore oil and gas facilities especially in the North Sea in the UK and point out the direction for the industry to improve its current multi-attribute decision-making models.}

The recent advances in machine translation (MT) offer an appealing and low-cost solution to overcome language barriers in multiple contexts (e.g., travelling, cultural interaction, digital content localisation). However, highly-technical domains typically exhibiting as long, complex, and specialised texts as the healthcare sector, pose multiple challenges to the effective and risk-safe use of MT.
Methods:
To examine how MT nowadays assists written/verbal health communication and because of the existing considerable heterogeneity in technological enablers, language pairs and user groups, training approaches, evaluation processes, and users” requirements, we propose in this paper a methodological multi-criteria literature review based on current guidelines in computer science research and grounded on a customised configuration of the PRISMA methodology, normally used to perform meta-analyses on clinical trials. The review focuses on language-to-language medical MT, covers the time period January 2015–February 2023, and only refers to articles written in English that are accessible via four scientific online digital libraries. Articles are ranked according to a meta-evaluation scoring method for MT scientific credibility along with a scoring for assessing the scope of MT in healthcare. Finally, a guideline to properly design a study about MT in healthcare is also proposed.
Results:
The review included a final set of 58 articles from journals (n=30) and conference proceedings (n=28), considering 48 different language combinations. We identified a predominance of English-to-Spanish (n=19) and English-to-Chinese (n=16) implementations, mainly tailored to medical staff only (n=14) or along with patients (n=12). Included papers addressed clinical communication (n=21) and health education (n=37). Unidirectional real-time bilingual MT (n=24) was the most frequent configuration. MT implementations were dominated by Google Translate (n=22) often used as baseline, OpenNMT (n=12), or Moses (n=11). Training and evaluation approaches varied considerably, while deployment and pre-/post-editing were rarely described with an adequate level of detail.
Conclusion:
Even if a significant number of articles reported that the proposed MT solutions were effective when translating (bio)medical texts, only a subset of them complied with rigorous translation quality assessment criteria (e.g., use of automatic metrics better related to human ranking than BLEU or statistical significance testing). Nevertheless, MT can be a valid support/supplement in health communication but to cope with issues in fluency, accuracy, unnatural translations, domain-adequacy, and potential safety risks (for highly-sensitive documents), appropriate MT training is essential, along with in-domain human post-editing. The presence of in-domain training text corpora has also proven to be beneficial. Finally, guidelines about how to design studies on MT in healthcare are also proposed to engage more researchers in this field.}

While these models have many promising applications, they also carry significant risks and potential dangers that must be carefully considered, such as misinformation, intellectual property violations, or biased information. For these reasons, in this work, we have proposed a method to detect whether a sentence is human-generated or AI-generated. To achieve this goal, we used a labeled dataset to train four different models from the BERT family, achieving an Accuracy of 96%.}

The existing large models can be briefly divided into three categories: large language models, visual large models, and multimodal large models. The application of large models in the oil and gas industry is still in its infancy. Based on open-source large language models, some oil and gas enterprises have released large language model products using methods like fine-tuning and retrieval augmented generation. Scholars have attempted to develop scenario-specific models for oil and gas operations by using visual/multimodal foundation models. A few researchers have constructed pre-trained foundation models for seismic data processing and interpretation, as well as core analysis. The application of large models in the oil and gas industry faces challenges such as current data quantity and quality being difficult to support the training of large models, high research and development costs, and poor algorithm autonomy and control.

abstract = {Chatbots are becoming a common trend in the service industry, education, and daily life. Increasing evidence has shown that chatbots have the potential to change the way people learn and search for information in human behavior. However, a systematic review of chatbot-related human behavior research with high citation rates has not been performed. Papers with high citation rates represent the latest changes in a particular research field, and reflect the current issues or research trends. By reading highly cited papers, researchers can identify important research questions. Therefore, this article presents a systematic literature review exploring the latest changes in chatbot research, and reviews the top 100 highly cited articles. The review shows that the highly cited chatbot-related studies have proposed new conversation strategies and compared different modes of human–human online conversations and human–chatbot conversations to find more effective methods of online communication. In addition, existing research has focused on high-level statistical performance and system development and testing. The findings also show that chatbots have started to be applied to the field of education, and there is much potential for the use of chatbots to improve the learning process and learning outcomes.}

In such models, the input sequence’s shape and size play a crucial role in learning the mapping function of the data distribution to the target output. This work examines numerous input configurations and sampling schemes for a many-to-one sequence prediction model, specifically for compressing 3D medical images (16-bit depth) losslessly. The main objective is to determine the optimal practice for enabling the proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to achieve high compression ratio and fast encoding–decoding performance. Our LSTM models are trained with 4-fold cross-validation on 12 high-resolution CT dataset while measuring model’s compression ratios and execution time. Several configurations of sequences have been evaluated, and our results demonstrate that pyramid-shaped sampling represents the best trade-off between performance and compression ratio (up to 3×). We solve a problem of non-deterministic environments that allow our models to run in parallel without much compression performance drop. Experimental evaluation was carried out on datasets acquired by different hospitals, representing different body segments, and distinct scanning modalities (CT and MRI). Our new methodology allows straightforward parallelisation that speeds-up the decoder by up to 37× compared to previous methods. Overall, the trained models demonstrate efficiency and generalisability for compressing 3D medical images losslessly while still outperforming well-known lossless methods by approximately 17% and 12%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on voxel-wise predictions of volumetric medical imaging for lossless compression.}

In this paper, we propose a data-driven and automated approach to carry out materiality assessment. Stakeholders’ perception of important topics is obtained by analyzing relevant textual documents (e.g., company reports, press releases, social media posts), identifying mentions of potentially interesting topics, and converting them to scores that produce materiality rankings or matrices. An iterative methodology is proposed to incrementally carry out materiality assessment by progressively building the domain knowledge required to automate the process.

Recently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has been an out-performing and well-established model in the task of Grammar Error Correction (GEC). Arabic GEC is still growing because of some challenges, such as scarcity of training sets and the complexity of Arabic language. To overcome these issues, we introduced an unsupervised method to generate large-scale synthetic training data based on confusion function to increase the amount of training set. Furthermore, we introduced a supervised NMT model for AGEC called SCUT AGEC. SCUT AGEC is a convolutional sequence-to-sequence model consisting of nine encoder-decoder layers with attention mechanism. We applied fine-tuning to improve the performance and get more efficient results. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) gives our model ability to joint feature extraction and classification in one task and we proved that it is an efficient way to capture features of the local context. Moreover, it is easy to obtain long-term dependencies because of convolutional layers staking. Our proposed model becomes the first supervised AGEC system based on the convolutional sequence-to-sequence learning to outperforms the current state-of-the-art neural AGEC models.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the critical need for innovative urban development solutions. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly turning to cutting-edge technologies—such as Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), Foundation Models (FMs), and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) frameworks—to transform urban planning and design practices. These transformative tools provide advanced capabilities to analyze complex urban systems, optimize resource management, and enable evidence-based decision-making. Despite recent progress, research on integrating GenAI and FMs into UDT frameworks remains scant, leaving gaps in our ability to capture complex urban flows and multimodal dynamics essential to achieving environmental sustainability goals. Moreover, the lack of a robust theoretical foundation and real-world operationalization of these tools hampers comprehensive modeling and practical adoption. This study introduces a pioneering Large Flow Model (LFM), grounded in a robust foundational framework and designed with GenAI capabilities. It is specifically tailored for integration into UDT systems to enhance predictive analytics, adaptive learning, and complex data management functionalities. To validate its applicability and relevance, the Blue City Project in Lausanne City is examined as a case study, showcasing the ability of the LFM to effectively model and analyze urban flows—namely mobility, goods, energy, waste, materials, and biodiversity—critical to advancing environmental sustainability. This study highlights how the LFM addresses the spatial challenges inherent in current UDT frameworks. The LFM demonstrates its novelty in comprehensive urban modeling and analysis by completing impartial city data, estimating flow data in new locations, predicting the evolution of flow data, and offering a holistic understanding of urban dynamics and their interconnections. The model enhances decision-making processes, supports evidence-based planning and design, fosters integrated development strategies, and enables the development of more efficient, resilient, and sustainable urban environments. This research advances both the theoretical and practical dimensions of AI-driven, environmentally sustainable urban development by operationalizing GenAI and FMs within UDT frameworks. It provides sophisticated tools and valuable insights for urban planners, designers, policymakers, and researchers to address the complexities of modern cities and accelerate the transition towards sustainable urban futures.}

abstract = {Owning to its merits of great temporal resolution, portability and low cost, electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have received increasing attention in emotion recognition. All the time, least square regression (LSR) has been widely employed in classification tasks. However, there exist two issues based on the LSR method, which limits its performance. The first problem is that the LSR method usually cannot make EEG data retain more discriminative information. The second is that it is improper for multiple emotion classification to use hard discrete labels as regression objectives. To address these issues, we develop orthogonal semi-supervised regression with adaptive label dragging model (OSRLD) to recognize emotions. OSRLD can get a closed-form solution with less computational costs. Furthermore, experimental findings using the open SEED-IV dataset show that 1) Compared to seven methods in terms of classification accuracy, OSRLD achieves the best average accuracy of 77.96%, 80.20% and 81.45%, 2) A technology of label dragging which modifies the label vector of each sample can effectively enlarge the distance between classes, and 3) Based on learned transformation matrix, the primary EEG frequency bands and brain areas are automatically identified, which lays theoretical basis for simplifying the hardware design of EEG acquisition devices.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in decision-making processes is gaining momentum. Specifically, Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems (MAS) hold considerable potential for transforming the landscape of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), particularly in addressing challenges posed by complex, multifaceted group decision-making environments. Conventionally, the collaborative expert weighting approach has been instrumental in spatial MCDM to ensure the accuracy and robustness of decisions. However, this approach is often subject to biases, significant time consumption, and logistical challenges in expert aggregation. This paper explores the feasibility of employing MAS and LLMs as substitutes for group expert-based weighting mechanisms in spatial MCDM by introducing the Weight Assignment by LLM-based MAS (WALMAS) method. In this method, LLMs such as OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot were regarded as primary agents, with multiple decision-making agents such as environment, urban planning, geography, and social specialists considered as a substitute for human experts depending on the nature of the problem. In the MAS space, following the parsing and extraction of initial weights from LLMs, a two-level algorithm was developed. The first level of this method involved the removal of outlier weights using the interquartile range (IQR) method. The second level of the method involved gradual negotiation and reaching consensus in an iterative process based on Kendall's W index. The proposed method, grounded in a GeoAI framework, was evaluated through its application to the landfill site selection problem. The findings and sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this method facilitates the efficient and reliable weighting of criteria, while ensuring the convergence of weights. Additionally, an analysis was conducted to identify the similarities and differences between LLMs in terms of weighting, as well as to determine the most effective expert agents in weighting. The analysis of human experts' satisfaction with the proposed method was also evaluated as very promising. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of AI-based tools in enhancing decision-making efficiency, consistency, and adaptability across spatial planning contexts.}

More importantly, the synergistic relationship among IR models, LLMs, and humans forms a new technical paradigm that is more powerful for information seeking. IR models provide real-time and relevant information, LLMs contribute internal knowledge, and humans play a central role of demanders and evaluators to the reliability of information services. Nevertheless, significant challenges exist, including computational costs, credibility concerns, domain-specific limitations, and ethical considerations. To thoroughly discuss the transformative impact of LLMs on IR research, the Chinese IR community conducted a strategic workshop in April 2023, yielding valuable insights.

However, those types of emotion recognition methods cannot detect human emotion well, because humankind can use fake body movement and words to hide real emotions. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-based emotion classification method based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Network (BiLSTM). Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal can detect human emotion correctly because human represent their real emotions in their mind and cannot hide emotions there. Meanwhile, EEG is a time sequence signal which needs a model which can deal with this type of data. Therefore, we chose Long Short-term Memory Network to process the EEG signal. In particular, we used an improvement version of LSTM model BiLSTM to manage the signals. BiLSTM can processes input data from front to back and back to front. Meanwhile, BiLSTM can store important information and forget unnecessary information; therefore, this process increases the accuracy of the model. Our method classifies four discrete classifications (happy, sad, fear, and neutral) for emotion classification, which achieves competitive performance compared with other conventional emotion classification methods. The final experimental results show that we can achieve an accuracy of 84.21% for four emotional states classification by using our method.}

abstract = {Multilingual English translation encounters substantial challenges stemming from the diverse syntactic structures, varied vocabulary, and limited data resources for certain language pairs. Traditional machine translation models, including Open Neural Machine Translation (OpenNMT), Transformer, and Opus-MT, frequently demonstrate limitations when addressing these complexities, resulting in problems with translation accuracy and fluency. These models generally necessitate large-scale parallel corpora and face difficulties in generalization across different languages. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces an innovative methodology that integrates the Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The T5 model, as evidenced by recent research (Reference 2), has demonstrated robust pre-trained language representations, which, when combined with MAML's rapid adaptation to new tasks using minimal data (Reference 1), leads to a significant improvement in translation quality. Experimental results show that the T5-MAML model outperforms OpenNMT, Transformer, and Opus-MT by 6.05%, 2.59%, and 2.05%, respectively, in terms of the mean BLEU score. Additionally, the T5-MAML model achieves a mean Translation Error Rate (TER) 11.13%, 6.03%, and 6.09% lower than the baseline models. In ablation studies, the T5-MAML model shows a 3.43% higher BLEU score and 8.52% lower TER compared to the T5-Large model. These results demonstrate that the integration of T5 and MAML not only improves the translation quality but also allows for faster adaptation to new language pairs, even with limited training data, making it a highly effective solution for multilingual translation tasks.}

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesised findings from 60 peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 and 2024, identified through MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science without language restrictions. Studies were selected based on alignment with three predefined components: mental health outcomes, family dynamics, and the effects of visual content. Statistical analyses, including subgroup and text-based methods, revealed both beneficial and adverse effects. While social media fostered connectivity and emotional support, it also contributed to cyberbullying and reinforced inequalities, particularly among females. Clustering techniques further identified cross-variable patterns. These findings highlight the complex, multidimensional impact of social media and emphasize the need for targeted interventions to mitigate risks and support digital well-being.}

abstract = {Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in various domains, revolutionising machine learning research. However, one persistent challenge is the scarcity of labelled training data, which hampers the performance and generalisation of deep learning models. To address this limitation, researchers have developed innovative methods to overcome data scarcity and enhance deep model learning capabilities. Two prevalent techniques that have gained significant attention are transfer learning and self-supervised learning. Transfer learning leverages knowledge learned from pre-training on a large-scale dataset, such as ImageNet, and applies it to a target task with limited labelled data. This approach allows models to benefit from the learned representations and effectively transfer knowledge to new tasks, resulting in improved learning performance and generalisation. On the other hand, self-supervised learning focuses on training models using pretext tasks that do not require manual annotation, allowing them to learn valuable representations from large amounts of unlabelled data. These learned representations can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks, mitigating the need for extensive labelled data. In recent years, transfer and self-supervised learning have found applications in various fields, including medical image processing, video recognition, and natural language processing. These approaches have demonstrated remarkable achievements, enabling breakthroughs in areas such as disease diagnosis, object recognition, and language understanding. However, while these methods offer numerous advantages, they also have limitations. For example, transfer learning may face domain mismatch issues between the pre-training and target domains, while self-supervised learning requires careful design of pretext tasks to ensure meaningful representations. This review paper explores the recent applications of these pre-training methods in various fields within the past three years. It delves into the advantages and limitations of each approach, assesses the performance of models employing these techniques, and identifies potential directions for future research. By providing a comprehensive review of current pre-training methods, this article offers guidance for selecting the best technique for specific deep learning applications to address the data scarcity issue.}

However, none of these studies focus on the real-world generalisability of the proposed approaches, that is whether the models perform well on datasets other than those on which they were initially trained and tested. In this work we aim to fill this gap by assessing the generalisability of top performing neural rumour verification models covering a range of different architectures from the perspectives of both topic and temporal robustness. For a more complete evaluation of generalisability, we collect and release COVID-RV, a novel dataset of Twitter conversations revolving around COVID-19 rumours. Unlike other existing COVID-19 datasets, our COVID-RV contains conversations around rumours that follow the format of prominent rumour verification benchmarks, while being different from them in terms of topic and time scale, thus allowing better assessment of the temporal robustness of the models. We evaluate model performance on COVID-RV and three popular rumour verification datasets to understand limitations and advantages of different model architectures, training datasets and evaluation scenarios. We find a dramatic drop in performance when testing models on a different dataset from that used for training. Further, we evaluate the ability of models to generalise in a few-shot learning setup, as well as when word embeddings are updated with the vocabulary of a new, unseen rumour. Drawing upon our experiments we discuss challenges and make recommendations for future research directions in addressing this important problem.}

The key contribution to AI lies in MoA’s ability to dynamically orchestrate these agents, each focusing on different aspects of a task, leading to a more comprehensive and effective problem-solving approach. In the domain of engineering, MoA finds its application in real-time decision-making systems, particularly in autonomous systems and intelligent control environments. By deploying MoA within these systems, we demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing precision and reliability in language-based decision-making processes.

Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. For example, distributed questionnaires lack the ability to provide real-time guidance and request immediate clarifications. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. However, considering decisions in transportation investments and policies often carry significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences, surveys and interviews face unique challenges in integrating AI agents. This issue underscors the need for a rigorous, explainable, and resource-efficient approach that enhances participant engagement and ensures privacy. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a modular approach accompanied by a parameterized process for designing and deploying AI agents for surveys and interviews, thereby supporting decision-makings in high-stakes contexts. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting conditional logic and multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) expert consultations about the impact of technologies on future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript postprocessing. The results suggest that the AI agent increases completion rates and response quality. Furthermore, the modular approach demonstrates controllability, flexibility, and robustness while addressing key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns. We believe this work lays the foundation for next-generation surveys and interviews in transportation research.}

Leveraging recent development in Natural Language Processing, we built an NLP-based course recommendation system specifically for the computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) fields. In particular, we built (1) a Named Entity Recognition (CSIT-NER) model to extract tech-related skills and entities, then used these skills to build (2) a personalized multi-level course recommendation system using a hybrid model (hybrid CSIT-CRS). Our CSIT-NER model, trained and fine-tuned on a large corpus of text extracted from StackOverflow and GitHub, can accurately extract the relevant skills and entities, outperforming state-of-the-art models across all evaluation metrics. Our hybrid CSIT-CRS can provide recommendations on multiple individualized levels of university courses, career paths with job listings, and industry-required with suitable online courses. The whole system received good ratings and feedback from users from our survey with 201 volunteers who are students and faculty members of tech universities in Australia and Vietnam.

Stock data are characterized by high dimensionality and sparsity, making stock trend prediction highly challenging. Although the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), based on web semantics, excels at capturing global features and efficiently performs in stock trend prediction, it does not consider the issue of declining prediction performance caused by the changing distribution of stock data over time (concept drift phenomenon). Accordingly, this work introduces the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) into the prediction model to leverage its ability to effectively capture local features. Additionally, local features are combined with global features to obtain a comprehensive set of feature information. Lastly, the model processes new data in real-time, continuously learns new knowledge, updates model parameters, and effectively addresses the decline in model performance caused by concept drift. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other models indicating its ability to efficiently perform well in stock trend prediction.}

In this paper, we define the problem as an aspect extraction task, and propose a novel deep learning model that comprises of three modules: pre-training language model embedding, multi-scale transmission network and contextual summary, which aims to provide an end-to-end solution without any additional supervision. To this end, we adopt BERT to overcome the disadvantage of traditional embedding methods, which cannot combine contextual information. Multi-scale transmission network is proposed to integrate the Bi-GRU and a group of CNN networks to extract sequential and local features of words respectively. Contextual summary is a tailor-made representation distilled from the input sentence, conditioned on each current word, and thus can assist aspect prediction. Experimental results over three benchmark SemEval datasets clearly illustrate that our model can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.}

Initially, YOLOv8 detects faces, enabling the creation of multi-scale graphs to analyze spatial relationships among features. A hybrid adaptive attention mechanism sharpens these features before processing them by a simplicial transformer network for dependency capture. Using a graph attention network enhances edge weighting, thereby improving recognition performance. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets namely AffectNet and FER2013 achieving accuracy of 81.84% and 90.40%, respectively. On occlusion and pose AffectNet dataset, the model demonstrates notable accuracy improvements of 3.7% and 4.2%, respectively, over the strongest baseline. Futhermore, cross-dataset validation is conducted with highest performance of 98.54% accuracy by combining (AffectNet and FER2013) for training and testing on additional CK+ dataset. Across these datasets, statistical significance is confirmed through paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, with p-values consistently below 0.05, validating the robustness of performance gains. Visualizations using Grad-CAM and t-SNE further validate the model's discriminative power and focus on expressive regions. These results demonstrate strong generalization and practical applicability of the proposed approach in real-world FER scenarios.}

A swine disease diagnosis model was proposed in this study, the Text-Guided Fusion Network-Swine Diagnosis (TGFN-SD) model, which integrated text case reports and disease images. The model integrated the differences and complementary information in the multimodal representation of diseases through the text-guided transformer module such that text case reports could carry the semantic information of disease images for disease identification. Moreover, it alleviated the phenotypic overlap problem caused by similar diseases in combination with supervised learning and self-supervised learning. Experimental results revealed that TGFN-SD achieved satisfactory performance on a constructed swine disease image and text dataset (SDT6K) that covered six disease classification datasets with accuracy and F1-score of 94.48 % and 94.4 % respectively. The accuracies and F1-scores increased by 8.35 % and 7.24 % compared with those under the unimodal situation and by 2.02 % and 1.63 % compared with those of the optimal baseline model under the multimodal fusion.

We classified data acquisition platforms utilised by the current commercial products. Then, we categorised the major crop management practices in grain farming. We also proposed a framework of the stages of precision agriculture that align with existing market products. We developed a novel taxonomy to categorise the technologies utilised by the AgTech industry for grain farming. We searched four Australian AgTech databases using a search strategy to capture all relevant commercial products related to the proposed crop management categories. In this survey, we categorised 80 AgTech products that provide tangible solutions to current farming practices based on the proposed taxonomy. We also analysed the current trends by mapping products across data acquisition platforms, crop management practices, and the precision agriculture cycle, as well as the types of technologies. Results show that commercial AgTech products mostly rely on ground-based stationary platforms for data acquisition, focus on crop protection, integrate proprietary hardware, and emphasise data visualisation rather than generating actionable insights. This finding also suggests that the high prevalence of proprietary hardware integration may indicate interoperability challenges, a significant barrier to AgTech adoption. Overall, this survey maps the breadth of commercially available AgTech in the grains industry and also discusses the opportunities for future research and innovation.}

abstract = {Portfolio optimization concerns with periodically allocating the limited funds to invest in a variety of potential assets in order to satisfy investors’ appetites for risk and return goals. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown its promising capabilities in sequential decision making problems. However, traditional DRL algorithms directly operate in the space of low-level actions, which exhibits poor scalability and becomes intractable in real-world problem instances when the dimensionality of the environment increases. To deal with this, in this work, a novel DRL hyper-heuristic framework is proposed for multi-period portfolio optimization problem. Instead of exploiting the entire action domain, our proposed approach is more effective by searching for low-level well-developed trading strategies. In addition, our proposed approach is data-driven and respects the nature of the problem by taking advantage of expert domain knowledge and posing it multidimensional states to further leverage additional diverse information from alternative views of the environment. The proposed approach is evaluated on five real-world capital market problem instances and numerous experimental results demonstrate our proposed method can achieve notable performance gains compared to state-of-art trading strategies as well as traditional DRL baseline method. The data we used are from five stock indices, covering the period from the 2012 to 2022. Our study can have salient policy implications for investment strategy formulation and effective regulatory frameworks establishment.}

abstract = {In the fast-paced realm of digital transformation, businesses are increasingly pressured to innovate and boost efficiency to remain competitive and foster growth. Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as game-changers across industries, revolutionizing various sectors by harnessing extensive text data to analyze and generate human-like text. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs often encounter challenges when dealing with domain-specific queries, potentially leading to inaccuracies in their outputs. In response, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a viable solution. By seamlessly integrating external data retrieval into text generation processes, RAG aims to enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated content. However, existing literature reviews tend to focus primarily on the technological advancements of RAG, overlooking a comprehensive exploration of its applications. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a thorough review of RAG applications, encompassing both task-specific and discipline-specific studies, while also outlining potential avenues for future research. By shedding light on current RAG research and outlining future directions, this review aims to catalyze further exploration and development in this dynamic field, thereby contributing to ongoing digital transformation efforts.}

In this study, we explored the use of embedding models to enhance semantic text similarity applications within the construction industry. The aim is to augment general-purpose language models by training them on a comprehensive construction and civil engineering data corpus to promote enhanced data integration and interoperability among diverse sources. Our methodology includes a comprehensive data collection and preprocessing pipeline, followed by a multi-stage fine-tuning approach that employs continuous pre-training, task-specific fine-tuning, and parameter-efficient adaptation algorithms. We assess the effectiveness of our models through intrinsic evaluations, including semantic similarity measures and domain-specific benchmarks. The test results demonstrate that our domain-adapted models, especially the Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation method, substantially surpass the fundamental language models in domain-specific tasks, including understanding technical terms and data alignment across domains. The results of the models show significant performance enhancements with minimal resource investment, making them appropriate for practical use.

For researchers in the education sector, the potential future state of AI, while provocative, is secondary to important shorter-term questions that influence how AI is integrated into learning and knowledge practices such as sensemaking and decision making. AI is not a future technology. It is already present in our daily lives, often shaping, behind the scenes, the types of information we encounter. It is, therefore, important to consider immediate questions surrounding the dynamics of human-machine interactions. In this paper, we focus on the relationship between human and artificial cognition and treat these as separate systems, each with distinct strengths and capabilities. We adopt a functional view (i.e., discrete tasks) of the activities that artificial cognition completes and those that are best handled by humans. This creates a foundation to then evaluate models for how these two cognitive systems interact and the mechanisms for coordination that are required. In doing so, we create a basis for future researchers to develop testable hypotheses regarding the impact of artificial cognition on knowledge processes such as learning, sensemaking, and decision making. Our evaluation provides insight for researchers regarding the optimal relationship between which cognitive activities should be handed off to the machine, which should remain the domain of human performance, and how these two should then be integrated when outputs are passed from one cognitive system (human or artificial) to the other.}

In today's financial landscape, characterized by the rapid growth of fintech and the extensive application of big data, the volume and complexity of financial transaction data are increasing. This has heightened the need for intelligent risk control models, posing significant challenges to traditional methods. In this case, research on intelligent risk control models based on deep learning has emerged as a new solution. This paper proposes a PSO-Xgboost-Transformer fusion deep learning model designed to enhance the performance of traditional risk control approaches in managing financial risks. The model integrates the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, the Xgboost model, and the Transformer model to leverage their respective strengths. Initially, the PSO algorithm is employed to select and optimize features, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Subsequently, the Xgboost model uses these optimized features for prediction and evaluation, generating preliminary risk prediction results.}

In this paper, we propose a two-stage solution (named with Dependency Graph Convolution based Contrastive Representation Learning) which includes a dependency graph convolution module to explicitly capture the semantic similarity between Chinese questions. At the first stage, we adopt the contrastive learning to further distinguish the similarity within the domain-specific corpus itself and learn discriminative textual representations. At the second stage, the down-streaming question matching task is benefited by using the newly-learned representations. In our experiments, we collect two Chinese medical datasets (CBLUE-STS and COVID-19) and the results can demonstrate that our proposed method is effective and general to different medical QA corpora. Also the ablation experiments indicate the proposed Dependency Graph Convolution module and contrastive learning method are both efficient.}

Most of the existing multimodal fake news detection methods focus on fully exploiting textual and visual features in news content, thus neglecting the full utilization of news social context features that play an important role in improving fake news detection. To this end, we propose a new fake news detection method based on CLIP contrastive learning and multimodal semantic alignment (SARD). SARD leverages cutting-edge multimodal learning techniques, such as CLIP, and robust cross-modal contrastive learning methods to integrate features of news-oriented heterogeneous information networks (N-HIN) with multi-level textual and visual features into a unified framework for the first time. This framework not only achieves cross-modal alignment between deep textual and visual features but also considers cross-modal associations and semantic alignments across different modalities. Furthermore, SARD enhances fake news detection by aligning semantic features between news content and N-HIN features, an aspect largely overlooked by existing methods. We test and evaluate SARD on three real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SARD significantly outperforms the twelve state-of-the-art competitors in fake news detection, with an average improvement of 2.89% in Mac.F1 score and 2.13% in accuracy compared to the leading baseline models across three datasets.}

First, approximately 3,900 documents from the intelligent emergency field are analyzed to determine the future research trend in intelligent emergency management. The socio-technical theory concerning technical and social systems is introduced. The emergency management system concepts of “technology enabling” and “enabling value creation” are defined according to bibliometric analysis and socio-technical theory. Second, a research framework that includes technology enabling and enabling value creation for the decision-making paradigm in emergency management according to the big data environment is constructed. A detailed analysis approach from intelligent emergency technology enabling to enabling value creation in emergency management is proposed. Finally, earthquake disasters are taken as examples, and specific analyses of the intelligent emergency enabling and enabling value creation are explored; enabling value creation is discussed based on measurable indicators. The clear concept of emergency management system technology enabling and enabling value creation, as well as the detailed analysis approach from intelligent emergency technology enabling to enabling value creation, provide a theoretical bases for scholars and practitioners to evaluate the value (performance) of intelligent emergency for the first time.}

However, while extensive research has focused on improving the performance of robot collaborative skills, systematic investigations into the instructional capabilities of cobots remain notably limited. To lay the technological foundation for addressing this gap, this survey adopts a multimodal perspective to review three essential aspects of this field: (1) robot learning from video (LfV) for instructional capabilities acquisition, (2) robot-guided instruction methodologies, and (3) feedback-driven adaptation. We present a systematic review of technologies for representing human actions, object states, and human-object interactions (HOI), with a particular focus on multimodal data sources from video. Furthermore, we analyze diverse instructional strategies, including visual guidance, auditory directives, robot-performed actions, emphasizing their effectiveness in robot-guided instruction. A significant focus is placed on feedback-driven adaptation mechanisms, which enable cobots to dynamically refine their instructional capabilities based on user feedback. We identify key challenges such as environmental complexity, user variability, real-time processing constraints, and trust-building requirements, while also highlighting emerging opportunities in multimodal integration, AI-powered robots, and collaborative learning systems.

This review explores the role of prompt engineering in unleashing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Prompt engineering is the process of structuring inputs, and it has emerged as a crucial technique for maximizing the utility and accuracy of these models. Both foundational and advanced prompt engineering methodologies—including techniques such as self-consistency, chain of thought, and generated knowledge, which can significantly enhance the performance of models—are explored in this paper. Additionally, the prompt methods for vision language models (VLMs) are examined in detail. Prompt methods are evaluated with subjective and objective metrics, ensuring a robust analysis of their efficacy. Critical to this discussion is the role of prompt engineering in artificial intelligence (AI) security, particularly in terms of defending against adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in LLMs. Strategies for minimizing these risks and improving the robustness of models are thoroughly reviewed. Finally, we provide a perspective for future research and applications.}

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a key preprocessing step for many NLP tasks. Its broad use in education links this study to Sustainable Development Goals in quality education. Yet models still struggle with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. This review maps current solutions. The authors screened 1,357 papers (Jan 2014–Jun 2024) from six databases—Mendeley, IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and ProQuest—and retained 50 high-quality studies. The review shows that the field has entered a maturity phase, with established approaches—including preprocessing strategies, hand-crafted features, and learned features—being used to address OOV words in POS tagging. Nevertheless, challenges remain in coping with language variation and low-resource data, which indirectly affect model accuracy. This review provides insights into how semantic-web-based strategies can be integrated to overcome these issues and offers guidance not only for POS tagging but also for other NLP tasks involving rare or unseen words.}

Being typically a free service and anonymity-friendly, massive spam email campaigns are common. Nowadays, spam email encompasses scam, phishing, malware distribution, and various other cybersecurity threats. Within these emails, recipients frequently encounter social engineering techniques aimed at persuading them to take an action, such as clicking on a hyperlink, opening an attachment or responding. In this paper, we conduct a study on supervised models to identify persuasion (binary classification) and to identify the specific persuasion techniques that are commonly used in spam email (multilabel classification). To achieve this, we develop systems capable of spotting persuasion in spam emails based on natural language processing techniques. We approach this challenging task at different levels of granularity: full email, sentences and specific text snippets (i.e. text fragments composed by one or more words, typically shorter than a sentence). We replicate and adapt two methodologies used to detect propaganda in news articles. Additionally, we build a custom spam email dataset, and fine-tune pre-trained RoBERTa-based transformer models to tackle the sentence level detection. This allows us to determine how extensively spam emails rely on persuasion to achieve their goals and, if so, to identify those techniques that would be employed for user protection and cybersecurity improvements.}

Using an abductive mixed-method case study of OpenAI’s ecosystem (2020–2025), we trace how governance, boundary resources, and institutional signals shape entrepreneurial feasibility, scaling, and vulnerability. Our analysis identifies four catalytic institutional mechanisms—Infrastructure Provision, Capability Scaffolding, Market Legitimization, and Ecosystem Orchestration—that enable venture creation while simultaneously generating dependence. Temporal analysis reveals an enablement–dependence paradox: platforms accelerate entry by democratizing frontier capabilities, yet accumulate dependencies that expose ventures to governance shocks. Empirically, we show how enthusiasm gave way to crisis during OpenAI’s GPT-5 release, illustrating governance overreach, trust erosion cascades, and choice removal as control. We conclude with theoretical and practical implications.}

abstract = {Training large language models (LLMs) can be prohibitively expensive. However, the emergence of new Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies provides a cost-effective approach to unlocking the potential of LLMs across a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this study, we selected the Mistral 7B language model as our primary LLM due to its superior performance, which surpasses that of LLAMA 2 13B across multiple benchmarks. By leveraging PEFT methods, we aimed to significantly reduce the cost of fine-tuning while maintaining high levels of performance. Despite their advancements, LLMs often struggle with translation tasks for low-resource languages, particularly morphologically rich African languages. To address this, we employed customized prompt engineering techniques to enhance LLM translation capabilities for these languages. Our experimentation focused on fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model to identify the best-performing ensemble using a custom prompt strategy. The results obtained from the fine-tuned Mistral 7B model were compared against several models: Serengeti, Gemma, Google Translate, and No Language Left Behind (NLLB). Specifically, Serengeti and Gemma were fine-tuned using the same custom prompt strategy as the Mistral model, while Google Translate and NLLB Gemma, which are pre-trained to handle English-to-Zulu and English-to-Xhosa translations, were evaluated directly on the test data set. This comparative analysis allowed us to assess the efficacy of the fine-tuned Mistral 7B model against both custom-tuned and pre-trained translation models. LLMs have traditionally struggled to produce high-quality translations, especially for low-resource languages. Our experiments revealed that the key to improving translation performance lies in using the correct prompt during fine-tuning. We used the Mistral 7B model to develop a custom prompt that significantly enhanced translation quality for English-to-Zulu and English-to-Xhosa language pairs. After fine-tuning the Mistral 7B model for 30 GPU days, we compared its performance to the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) model and Google Translator API on the same test dataset. While NLLB achieved the highest scores across BLEU, G-Eval (cosine similarity), and Chrf++ (F1-score), our results demonstrated that Mistral 7B, with the custom prompt, still performed competitively. Additionally, we showed that our prompt template can improve the translation accuracy of other models, such as Gemma and Serengeti, when applied to high-quality bilingual datasets. This demonstrates that our custom prompt strategy is adaptable across different model architectures, bilingual settings, and is highly effective in accelerating learning for low-resource language translation.}

The second main limitation is the contextualization of manufacturing systems and the exploitation of manufacturing domain knowledge, which requires a dynamic and holistic representation of knowledge. The last major obstacle arises from the facilitation of intricate decision-making processes towards correlated manufacturing ecosystems, which benefit from interconnected data structures that KGs excel at organizing. However, the existing survey studies concentrated on distinct facets of SM and offered isolated insights into KG applications while overlooking the interconnections between various KG technologies and their application across multiple domains. What specific role KGs should play in SM towards the aforementioned challenges, how to effectively harness KGs for these challenges, and the essential topics and methodologies required to make KGs functional remain underexplored. To explore the potential of KGs in SM, this study adopts a systematic approach to investigate, evaluate, and analyse current research on KGs, identifying core advancements and their implications for future manufacturing practices. Firstly, cutting-edge developments in the challenge-driven roles of KGs and KG techniques are identified, from knowledge extraction and mining to techniques for KG construction and updates, further extending to KG embedding, fusion, and reasoning—central to driving SM ecosystems. Specifically, the KG technologies for SM are depicted holistically, emphasizing the interplay of diverse KG techniques with a comprehensive framework. Subsequently, this foundation outlines and discusses key application scenarios of KGs from engineering design to predictive maintenance, covering the main representative stages of the manufacturing life cycle.

The process involves computing sentence embeddings using Language-agnostic BERT and selecting sentence pairs based on high and low cosine similarity. Subsequently, we train the Wav2vec 2.0 XLSR53 model on these datasets and assess its performance utilizing Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER) metrics. The experimental results indicate that models trained on high-similarity samples consistently surpass their low-similarity counterparts, emphasizing the significance of high semantic similarity data selection for precise and dependable ASR performance. Furthermore, the elimination of LID contributes to a simplified system with reduced computational costs and the capacity for real-time text output. The findings of this research offer valuable insights for the development of more efficient and accurate multilingual ASR systems, particularly in real-time and on-device applications.}

abstract = {Recommender systems, in real-world circumstances, tend to limit user exposure to certain topics and to overexpose them to others to maximize performance. However, repeated exposure to biased content could lead to the so-called echo chamber phenomenon: especially in social network environments, people encounter only information that reflects their previous beliefs and opinions, reinforcing them. This phenomenon could have worrying consequences for society, including the spread of aggressive, unhealthy, or risky behaviors. Some persons can be more affected than others by echo-chambers. We define as sensitive the users whose behavior could be influenced by the over- or under-exposure to certain items due to the echo-chamber effect, and as influential the items that could influence the behavior of such users. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending influential items to sensitive users. We formalize the problem and propose three techniques that can be used to diversify the distributions of influential items in order to positively affect sensitive users’ behavior. Recommendations that meet this diversity criterion could potentially avoid dangerous societal consequences and simultaneously promote healthier lifestyles. We tested the proposed techniques in a real-world dataset by considering two different case studies that involved potentially aggressive and potentially depressed users. All techniques have been proven to be effective and allow high performance to be maintained while diversifying recommendations.}

Despite its transformative potential, comprehensive information on agentic AI remains scarce in the literature. This paper provides the first comprehensive review of agentic AI, focusing on its evolution and three core aspects: patterns, types, and environments. The evolution of agentic AI is traced through five phases to the current era of multi-modal and collaborative agents, driven by advancements in reinforcement learning, neural networks, and large language models (LLMs). Five key patterns: tool use, reflection, ReAct, planning, and multi-agent collaboration (MAC) define how agentic AI systems interact and process tasks. These systems are categorized into seven categories, each tailored for specific operational styles and autonomy in decision making. The environments in which these agents operate are classified as static, dynamic, fully observable, partially observable, deterministic, stochastic, single-agent, and multi-agent, emphasizing the impact of environmental complexity on agent behavior. Agentic AI has revolutionized systems through autonomous decision making and resource optimization, yet challenges persist in aligning AI with human values, ensuring adaptability, and addressing ethical constraints. Future research focuses on multidomain agents, human-AI collaboration, and self-improving systems. This work provides researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a structured approach to understanding and advancing the rapidly evolving landscape of agentic AI systems.}

This systematic review examines 84 publications (2014–2024) on the application of UDTs for enhancing built-environment perception and facilitating public participation in urban planning. Results indicate a rapid increase in UDT research post-2020, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia, led by the United States, China, and Germany. However, significant gaps remain, notably the underrepresentation of rural and peri-urban contexts, highlighting geographic and contextual biases. UDT studies primarily focus on visual and functional perception, with limited attention to auditory and risk perception dimensions. Additionally, most research concentrates on meso-scale (neighbourhood or city-level) contexts, revealing scale-specific limitations. Public participation varied widely, with academia and government predominantly driving initiatives, while direct citizen engagement remained comparatively limited. Interactive participation through immersive visualization technologies (e.g., VR, AR) effectively enhanced stakeholder involvement and perceptual understanding, yet raised equity concerns regarding accessibility and technological inclusivity. Future UDT research should prioritize expanding into diverse geographic and contextual settings, incorporating overlooked perceptual dimensions, and developing equitable, accessible technologies. Embracing hybrid participatory models and interoperable, geospatially-aware frameworks will be crucial for leveraging UDTs as comprehensive tools for citizen-centric and sustainable urban planning.}

This area studies the consistent behavior of text Classification models under attacks. These attacks use perturbation methods based on applying semantic and label-preserving changes to the inputs. However, the fragmented landscape of individual attack implementations, dispersed across code repositories, poses complicates the development and application of comprehensive adversarial strategies for model enhancement. To address these challenges, this paper introduces AI-Q, a Python framework specifically designed for text Classification adversarial attacks and data augmentation. One of the major strengths of our framework lies in its extensive library of perturbation methods for adversarial attacks (24 in total), and its evaluation metrics for model robustness. The framework exhibits versatility by supporting both custom models and those from the HuggingFace ecosystem, ensuring broad compatibility with leading benchmarks in the field. Beyond adversarial attacks, AI-Q can be used for data augmentation, enabling users to harness the components of adversarial attacks to increase dataset diversity. Finally, our evaluation, including human annotations, highlights the AI-Q potential for model robustness.}

These advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. What challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing AI, AIoT, and UDT in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? Methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between January 2019 and December 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. The findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating AI, AIoT, and UDT technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. By enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. However, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. This study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development. These insights have profound implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing a roadmap for fostering resiliently designed, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious urban environments.}

The aim is to introduce a model that can efficiently perform these tasks. The statistical population for this study encompasses all scientific databases, with a particular emphasis on Scopus. To clarify the process of KR and KD as we define it, we employed a systematic review and meta-analysis framework using 33 queries. We conducted the identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion steps following the PRISMA protocol. Next, we performed extraction, labeling, grouping, analysis, and inference. The outcome of these processes provided us with novel insights, which contribute to our exploratory knowledge. To automate these processes, we have proposed a conceptual model from query-based indirect abstractive summarization approach. The outcomes of this research offer fresh insights to database designers, administrators, and researchers, enabling the development of tools for KR and KD within these invaluable knowledge repositories.

A burgeoning research literature addresses this question by examining psychotherapy microprocesses, which typically referred to within-session changes of therapy processes, aiming to bridge psychotherapy research with clinical practice. In this pre-registered systematic review, we reviewed 86 empirical quantitative studies examining observational psychotherapy microprocesses over 35 years. We extracted 28 microprocess constructs across six categories (affective/emotional, behavioral, cognitive, relational/interpersonal, linguistic, and movement), four key methodological features of operationalizing microprocesses, and three types of research questions that focused on within-session change patterns, dyadic and intra-personal momentary associations, and associations with outcomes/macroprocesses/predictors. The literature demonstrated unique advantages in embracing theoretical plurality, real-world settings, and dyadic influences, while being limited by theoretical and methodological challenges such as the scatteredness in construct operationalizations, limited inclusion of diverse samples/therapy modalities and culture-related constructs, disconnections from theoretically driven hypotheses, and a lack of standard in reporting methodological features. To address these challenges, we propose the Multilevel Integrative Microprocess Model (MIMM), an integrative framework that situates microprocesses within the broader context of psychotherapy research traditionally centered on macro-level processes and outcomes. We conclude by suggesting a future research agenda that provides a checklist for future microprocess studies to enhance theoretical coherence and methodological rigor.}

The intricate interplay of these risk factors, combined with the dynamic nature of community environments, presents difficulties for traditional risk assessment methodologies to address effectively. Initially, this paper delves into the factors influencing safety incidents within communities and establishes a comprehensive system of safety risk assessment indicators. Leveraging the adaptable and generalizable nature of the BPNN model, the paper proceeds to optimize the BPNN model, enhancing the security risk assessment model through this optimization. Subsequent comparison experiments with traditional models validate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed model, with hidden layer nodes set at various levels like 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35. These traditional models include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBOOST). Experimental findings demonstrate that with 20 hidden layer nodes, the optimized model achieves a remarkable final recognition accuracy of 99.1 %. Moreover, the optimized model exhibits significantly lower final function loss compared to models with different node numbers. Increasing the number of hidden layer nodes may diminish the optimized model's fit and accuracy. Comparison with traditional models reveals that the average accuracy of the optimized model in community risk identification reaches 98.5 %, with a maximum accuracy of 99.6 %. This marks an improvement of 9%–11 % in recognition accuracy across various risk factors compared to traditional models. Regarding system response time and resource utilization, the optimized model exhibits a response time ranging from 100 ms to 120 ms and consistently lower resource utilization rates across all scenarios, underscoring its efficiency in community security risk assessment. In conclusion, this experiment sheds light on the underlying mechanisms and patterns of community safety risk formation, offering novel perspectives and methodologies for researching community safety risk assessment. The paper concludes by presenting recommendations and strategies for addressing community safety risks based on experimental analysis.}

abstract = {A knowledge graph is a structured graph in which data obtained from multiple sources are standardized to acquire and integrate human knowledge. Research is being actively conducted to cover a wide variety of knowledge, as it can be applied to applications that help humans. However, existing researches are constructing knowledge graphs without the time information that knowledge implies. Knowledge stored without time information becomes outdated over time, and in the future, the possibility of knowledge being false or meaningful changes is excluded. As a result, they can’t reflect information that changes dynamically, and they can’t accept information that has newly emerged. To solve this problem, this paper proposes Time-Aware PolarisX, an automatically extended knowledge graph including time information. Time-Aware PolarisX constructed a BERT model with a relation extractor and an ensemble NER model including a time tag with an entity extractor to extract knowledge consisting of subject, relation, and object from unstructured text. Through two application experiments, it shows that the proposed system overcomes the limitations of existing systems that do not consider time information when applied to an application such as a chatbot. Also, we verify that the accuracy of the extraction model is improved through a comparative experiment with the existing model.}

abstract = {Idea generation describes a creative process involving reasoning over some knowledge to derive new information. Traditional approaches such as mind-map and brainstorming are limited and often fail due to lack of quality ideas and ineffective methods. The reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) have been investigated for ideation tasks and have reported interesting performance. However, these models suffer from limited logical reasoning capability which hinders the use of structural and factual real-world knowledge in discovery of latent insight and predict possible outcome when applied to ideation. In addition, the possibility of LLMs regurgitating knowledge learnt from datasets might adversely impact the degree of novel ideas the models can generate. In this paper, a two-stage logical reasoning approach is applied to initiate the search for candidate idea pathways based on the knowledge graphs (KGs) to address the problem of reasoning, domain-specificity and novelty. The divergence stage this reasoning explores utilizes a new node importance estimation (NIE) technique over KGs to discover latent connections supporting idea generation. In the convergence stage of this reasoning, subgraph matching using analogical reasoning (SMAR) is applied to find matching patterns to describe a new idea. The use of SMAR + NIE and KGs helps to achieve an improvement in reasoning over KGs before transferring such reasoning to LLMs for translation of idea into natural language. To evaluate the degree of novelty of ideas generated, a relevance-to-novelty scoring metrics is proposed based on multiple premise entailment (MPE). We combined this metric with other popular metrics to evaluate the performance of SMAR + NIE on benchmark datasets, and as well on the quality of ideas generated. Findings from the study showed that this approach demonstrates competitive performance with mainstream LLMs in idea generation tasks.}

Growth of the older adult population has led to an increasing interest in technology-supported aged care. However the area has some challenges such as lack of care givers and limitations in understanding the emotional, social, physical, and mental well-being needs of older adults. Furthermore, there is a gap in the understanding between younger developers and ageing people of their requirements from digital systems. Digital health can play an important role supporting older adults’ well-being, emotional requirements, and social needs.
Objective:
We carried out a systematic review of the literature on RE for older adult digital health software. This was necessary to show the representatives of the current stage of understanding the needs of older adults in aged care digital health.
Methods:
Using established guidelines we developed a protocol, followed by the systematic search of eight databases. This resulted in 69 primary studies of high relevance, which were subsequently subjected to data extraction, synthesis, and reporting.
Results:
This systematic literature review highlights key RE processes used in digital health software for older people. It explored the key features developed for many digital solutions, utilization of technology for older user well-being and care, and the evaluations of proposed solutions. The review also identified key limitations found in existing primary studies that inspire future research opportunities.
Conclusion:
Our results indicate that requirements gathering and understanding have a significant variation between different studies. The differences are in the quality, depth, and techniques adopted for requirement gathering and this reason for these differences is largely due to uneven adoption of RE methods.}

abstract = {Social media has significantly accelerated the rapid dissemination of information, but it also boosts propagation of fake news, posing serious challenges to public awareness and social stability. In real-world contexts, the volume of trustable information far exceeds that of rumors, resulting in a class imbalance that leads models to prioritize the majority class during training. This focus diminishes the model’s ability to recognize minority class samples. Furthermore, models may experience overfitting when encountering these minority samples, further compromising their generalization capabilities. Unlike node-level classification tasks, fake news detection in social networks operates on graph-level samples, where traditional interpolation and oversampling methods struggle to effectively generate high-quality graph-level samples. This challenge complicates the identification of new instances of false information. To address this issue, this paper introduces the FHGraph (Fake News Hunting Graph) framework, which employs a generative data augmentation approach and a latent diffusion model to create graph structures that align with news communication patterns. Using the few-sample learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), the framework generates diverse texts for minority class nodes. FHGraph comprises a hierarchical multiview graph contrastive learning module, in which two horizontal views and three vertical levels are utilized for self-supervised learning, resulting in more optimized representations. Experimental results show that FHGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) graph-level class imbalance methods and SOTA graph-level contrastive learning methods. Specifically, FHGraph has achieved a 2% increase in F1 Micro and a 2.5% increase in F1 Macro in the PHEME dataset, as well as a 3.5% improvement in F1 Micro and a 4.3% improvement in F1 Macro on RumorEval dataset.}

However, current approaches for CI modeling, monitoring, and resilience assessment are lacking a holistic view of cities as complex, interconnected, and socio-technical systems. This paper explores the application of the Digital Twin (DT) concept as a promising tool to assess and improve the resilience of urban CIs in light of various hazards. DTs are virtual real-time representations of a physical system that can be used to perform real-time analysis, simulate what-if scenarios, and provide decision support, during crises and normal operations. To this end, we identify and discuss key challenges for the development of Urban Digital Twins (UDTs), including data management, technical and social modeling of CIs, integrated CI co-simulations, model validation, and resilience assessment. To address the complex nature of urban areas as systems-of-systems, we present overarching modeling concepts by considering CI interdependencies and socio-technical interactions, resulting in the concept of the Socio-technical Digital Twin (STDT). Beside incorporating agent-based modeling, we discuss the issue of demand synchronization and propose the concepts of model selection and model transfer to facilitate the modeling process for UDTs. Furthermore, a multi-layered modeling framework for interdependent urban CIs is presented, where the proposed concepts are integrated and an overview and discussion of the technical and social modeling of CIs is provided, with a particular focus on the power, water, and transportation domain. Finally, we deal with the quantitative resilience assessment for interconnected CIs and discuss ways of integrating these methodologies in DTs. Our approach frames CIs as socio-technical systems and integrates the human perspective into the modeling process and resilience assessment. The presented modeling framework can be used to simulate various scenarios for analyzing their consequences in advance and measuring resilience in a holistic context. Moreover, the proposed concepts and modeling approaches can support future developments towards UDTs for crisis management.}

Traditional semantic annotation faces the problem of dataset diversity. Different fields and scenarios need to be specially annotated, and annotation work usually requires a lot of manpower and time investment. To meet these challenges, this paper deeply studies the semantic annotation model and method based on internet open datasets, aiming to improve annotation efficiency and accuracy and promote data resource sharing and utilization. This paper selects Common Crawl dataset to provide sufficient training samples; methods such as removing stop words and deduplication are used to preprocess data to improve data quality; a keyword extraction model based on heuristic rules and text context is constructed. In terms of semantic annotation model, this paper constructs a model based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), which can make full use of the part-of-speech information of the corpus context, capture the part-of-speech features of the corpus, and generate semantic tags through supervised learning.}

If there is a word that has similar contextual information to the OOV, the word can be used to understand the OOV. They chose the Weibo corpus as the dataset for the experiments.

With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and the growing prominence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, new avenues for the dissemination of disinformation are emerging. This review paper explores the potential of LLMs to initiate the generation of multi-media disinformation, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. We begin by examining the capabilities of LLMs, highlighting their potential to create compelling, context-aware content that can be weaponized for malicious purposes. Subsequently, we examine the nature of disinformation and the various mechanisms through which it spreads in the digital landscape. Utilizing these advanced models, malicious actors can automate and scale up disinformation effectively. We describe a theoretical pipeline for creating and disseminating disinformation on social media. Existing interventions to combat disinformation are also reviewed. While these efforts have shown success, we argue that they need to be strengthened to effectively counter the escalating threat posed by LLMs. Digital platforms have, unfortunately, enabled malicious actors to extend the reach of disinformation. The advent of LLMs poses an additional concern as they can be harnessed to significantly amplify the velocity, variety, and volume of disinformation. Thus, this review proposes augmenting current interventions with AI tools like LLMs, capable of assessing information more swiftly and comprehensively than human fact-checkers. This paper illuminates the dark side of LLMs and highlights their potential to be exploited as disinformation dissemination tools.}

ADR Detection aims to automatically determine whether a sentence is related to an ADR, which is a fundamental study for public health monitoring tasks, particularly for pharmacovigilance. Benchmark corpora are mostly sampled from biomedical literature or social media, but most of them are on small scales. Correspondingly, existing ADR detection models are either trained with additional corpora that are annotated manually or jointly trained with the ADR detection and the entity mention extraction task. However, directly training a method with additional corpora sampled from different sources may introduce noises and impact the performance of neural networks. Besides, jointly training a method with different tasks requires the annotation for other tasks, which still increases the annotation workload. To address the above issues, we formulate ADR detection as a text classification task and introduce an adversarial transfer learning framework into ADR detection. Our method focuses on exploiting a source corpus to improve the performance on small target corpora which only contain hundreds of training instances. Also, adversarial learning is applied to prevent corpus-specific features from being introduced into shared space so that corpora from different sources can be leveraged with minimum extra noises. Experimental results on three different benchmark corpora show that our proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, especially on small corpora.}

In user experience (UX) based design innovation, user-generated data and archived design documents are two valuable resources for various design activities such as identifying opportunities and generating design ideas. However, these two resources are usually isolated in different systems. Additionally, design information typically represented based on functional aspects is limited for UX-oriented design. To facilitate experience-oriented design activities, we propose a twin data-driven approach to integrate UX data and archived design documents. In particular, we aim to extract UX concepts from product reviews and design concepts from patents respectively and to discover associations between the extracted concepts. First, a UX-integrated design information representation model is proposed to associate capabilities with key elements of UX at the concept, category, and aspect levels of information. Based on this model, a twin data-driven approach is developed to bridge experience information and design information. It contains three steps: experience aspect identification using an attention-based LSTM (Long short-term memory) network, design information categorization based on topic clustering using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and LAD (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model, and experience needs and design information integration by leveraging word embedding techniques to measure concept similarity. A case study using healthcare-related experience and design information has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach.}

First, false and real news samples are collected from news websites and social media platforms for labeling, cleaning, deduplication and feature extraction.

Text features are extracted through TF-IDF and word embedding technology, and a multi-task learning strategy is introduced to optimize fake news detection and content recommendation. The loss function is the weighted sum of classification loss and recommendation loss. In the recommendation strategy, reinforcement learning is used in combination with user feedback to dynamically adjust the recommended content and reduce the spread of misleading information. Experimental results show that the performance of the optimized model is significantly improved: the accuracy is increased by an average of 6.26%, reaching a maximum of 89.7%; the system response time is shortened from 5-6 seconds to 3-4 seconds, an average of 1.9 seconds; the recall rate is increased from 72.8%-79.1% to 85.4%-89.1%, with the maximum increase of 11.6%. The conclusion shows that through data expansion, feature engineering and model optimization, the performance of fake news detection has been significantly improved, and the misjudgment and missed detection rates have been significantly reduced. At the same time, combined with precise recommendation strategies, the user experience has been effectively improved, providing technical support and practical solutions for false information governance.}

Here, we present a deep learning-based querying pipeline capable of generating “impossible queries”, those requiring inference over latent relationships, contextual understanding, and multimodal reasoning. Our system integrates Gemini 1.5 Pro and a fine-tuned BERT model to process complex inputs across text, image, and document modalities, enriching static records with derived features. We demonstrate that this architecture enables robust performance across basic, advanced, and integrated reasoning scenarios. Unlike conventional methods limited to explicit fields or handcrafted rules, our approach dynamically identifies subtle attributes, such as the presence of stylized imagery or implicit product features, and translates them into actionable primary key filters. We evaluate the system against state-of-the-art baselines, including CLIP, RAG, and heuristic SQL matches, achieving 99% accuracy across real-world annotated scenarios. The pipeline outperforms traditional CRUD operations in relevance, especially in multi-tenant and cloud-based environments where schema heterogeneity and data complexity are prevalent. Through experiments on Amazon product datasets, we show how our system distinguishes between nuanced cases like stylized versus real photos and infers attributes despite their absence in structured fields. These findings highlight the potential of integrating deep learning into querying frameworks to unlock latent insights and automate reasoning at scale. Our results mark a significant step toward intelligent database systems capable of reasoning beyond their schemas and responding meaningfully to real-world human intent.}

We investigate the characteristics of the Continual Pre-Training scenario, where a model is continually pre-trained on a stream of incoming data and only later fine-tuned to different downstream tasks. We introduce an evaluation protocol for Continual Pre-Training which monitors forgetting against a Forgetting Control dataset not present in the continual stream. We disentangle the impact on forgetting of 3 main factors: the input modality (NLP, Vision), the architecture type (Transformer, ResNet) and the pre-training protocol (supervised, self-supervised). Moreover, we propose a Sample-Efficient Pre-training method (SEP) that speeds up the pre-training phase. We show that the pre-training protocol is the most important factor accounting for forgetting. Surprisingly, we discovered that self-supervised continual pre-training in both NLP and Vision is sufficient to mitigate forgetting without the use of any Continual Learning strategy. Other factors, like model depth, input modality and architecture type are not as crucial.}

The model obtains a more comprehensive representation of textual relations by graph-structured processing of the input text, and at the same time obtains a single vector representation by weighted merging of the vector sequences after graph-structured processing to get an effective potential representation. In the process of potential representation guiding text generation, the model adopts a combination of traditional embedding and potential attention calculation to give full play to the guiding role of potential representation for generating text, to improve the controllability and effectiveness of text generation. The experimental results show that the model has excellent representation learning ability and can learn rich and useful textual relationship representations. The model also achieves satisfactory results in the effectiveness and controllability of text generation and can generate long texts that match the given constraints. The ROUGE-1 F1 score of this model is 0.243, the ROUGE-2 F1 score is 0.041, the ROUGE-L F1 score is 0.22, and the PPL-Word score is 34.303, which gives the GSPT-CVAE model a certain advantage over the baseline model.

A content-based recommender system is a subclass of information systems that recommends an item to the user based on its description. It suggests items such as news, documents, articles, webpages, journals, and more to users as per their inclination by comparing the key features of the items with key terms or features of user interest profiles. This paper proposes the new methodology using Non-IIDness-based semantic term-term coupling from the content referred by users to enhance recommendation results. In the proposed methodology, the semantic relationship is analyzed by estimating the explicit and implicit relationship between terms. It associates terms that are semantically related in the real world or are used interchangeably such as synonyms. The underestimated features of user profiles have been enhanced after term-term relation analysis, which results in improved similarity estimation of relevant items with the user profiles. The experimentation result proves that the proposed methodology improves the overall search and retrieval results as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.}

Humans on the other hand are experts at multi-modal thinking and can embed new inputs almost instantly into a conceptual knowledge space shaped by experience. In many fields the aim is to build systems capable of explaining themselves, engaging in interactive what-if questions. Such questions, called counterfactuals, are becoming important in the rising field of explainable AI (xAI). Our central hypothesis is that using conceptual knowledge as a guiding model of reality will help to train more explainable, more robust and less biased machine learning models, ideally able to learn from fewer data. One important aspect in the medical domain is that various modalities contribute to one single result. Our main question is “How can we construct a multi-modal feature representation space (spanning images, text, genomics data) using knowledge bases as an initial connector for the development of novel explanation interface techniques?”. In this paper we argue for using Graph Neural Networks as a method-of-choice, enabling information fusion for multi-modal causability (causability – not to confuse with causality – is the measurable extent to which an explanation to a human expert achieves a specified level of causal understanding). The aim of this paper is to motivate the international xAI community to further work into the fields of multi-modal embeddings and interactive explainability, to lay the foundations for effective future human–AI interfaces. We emphasize that Graph Neural Networks play a major role for multi-modal causability, since causal links between features can be defined directly using graph structures.}

abstract = {Background
In an era dominated by social media conversations, it is pivotal to comprehend how suicide, a critical public health issue, is discussed online. Discussions around suicide often highlight a range of topics, such as mental health challenges, relationship conflicts, and financial distress. However, certain sensitive issues, like those affecting marginalized communities, may be underrepresented in these discussions. This underrepresentation is a critical issue to investigate because it is mainly associated with underserved demographics (eg, racial and sexual minorities), and models trained on such data will underperform on such topics.
Objective
The objective of this study was to bridge the gap between established psychology literature on suicidal ideation and social media data by analyzing the topics discussed online. Additionally, by generating synthetic data, we aimed to ensure that datasets used for training classifiers have high coverage of critical risk factors to address and adequately represent underrepresented or misrepresented topics. This approach enhances both the quality and diversity of the data used for detecting suicidal ideation in social media conversations.
Methods
We first performed unsupervised topic modeling to analyze suicide-related data from social media and identify the most frequently discussed topics within the dataset. Next, we conducted a scoping review of established psychology literature to identify core risk factors associated with suicide. Using these identified risk factors, we then performed guided topic modeling on the social media dataset to evaluate the presence and coverage of these factors. After identifying topic biases and gaps in the dataset, we explored the use of generative large language models to create topic-diverse synthetic data for augmentation. Finally, the synthetic dataset was evaluated for readability, complexity, topic diversity, and utility in training machine learning classifiers compared to real-world datasets.
Results
Our study found that several critical suicide-related topics, particularly those concerning marginalized communities and racism, were significantly underrepresented in the real-world social media data. The introduction of synthetic data, generated using GPT-3.5 Turbo, and the augmented dataset improved topic diversity. The synthetic dataset showed levels of readability and complexity comparable to those of real data. Furthermore, the incorporation of the augmented dataset in fine-tuning classifiers enhanced their ability to detect suicidal ideation, with the F1-score improving from 0.87 to 0.91 on the University of Maryland Reddit Suicidality Dataset test subset and from 0.70 to 0.90 on the synthetic test subset, demonstrating its utility in improving model accuracy for suicidal narrative detection.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that synthetic datasets can be useful to obtain an enriched understanding of online suicide discussions as well as build more accurate machine learning models for suicidal narrative detection on social media.}

Several studies have provided effective models for detecting fake news in social networks through a variety of methods; however, there are limitations. Furthermore, since it is a critical field, the accuracy of the detection models was found to be notably insufficient. Although many review articles have addressed the repercussions of fake news, most have focused on specific and recurring aspects of fake news detection models. For example, the majority of reviews have primarily focused on dividing datasets, features, and classifiers used in this field by type. The limitations of the datasets, their features, how these features are fused, and the impact of all these factors on detection models were not investigated, especially since most detection models were based on a supervised learning approach. This review article analyzes relevant studies for the few last years and highlights the challenges faced by fake news detection models and their impact on their performance. The investigation of fake news detection studies relied on the following aspects and their impact on detection accuracy, namely datasets, overfitting/underfitting, image-based features, feature vector representation, machine learning models, and data fusion. Based on the analysis of relevant studies, the review showed that these issues significantly affect the performance and accuracy of detection models.

abstract = {The development of social networks plays a stronger role in the increased importance of social bot detection. One of the most common existing graph-based detection methods is graph neural networks (GNNs). However, researchers mainly focus on the improvement of GNN architecture while neglecting the in-depth analysis of social network structure. In this paper, after in-depth analysis of the social graph structure, it demonstrate that there exists a graph stratification phenomenon, i.e., the social graph is divided into central and peripheral layers according to its topology. Based on this phenomenon, the idea that the social robot detection task should focus on the central node is proposed, and the existing detection task is adapted to a central node classification task. The task is then further investigated, and the Peripheral-Enhanced Graph Neural Network (PEGNN) framework is proposed to tackle the problem that existing frameworks cannot effectively utilize the information of peripheral networks. PEGNN effectively utilizes the information of peripheral networks via the synergistic effect of three losses. Eventually, the graph stratification phenomenon is verified on two datasets, and the original task is adjusted for central node classification to verify the enhancement effect of PEGNN. The experimental results exhibit that PEGNN obviously improves the model performance. On Twibot-20, the average improvement in accuracy is 1.30%, and the average improvement in F1 score is 1.37%; on Twibot-22, the average improvement in accuracy is 2.46%, the average improvement in F1 score is 5.91%; apparently, other metrics also show obvious improvement.}

abstract = {Background:
Biomedical natural language processing (NLP) increasingly relies on large language models and extensive datasets, presenting significant computational challenges.
Methods:
We propose Blue5, a multi-task model based on SciFive that incorporates instance selection (IS) to enable efficient, multi-task learning (MTL) on biomedical data. We adapt the E2SC-IS framework for the biomedical domain, integrating a calibrated SVM classifier to reduce computational costs.
Results:
Our approach achieves an average data reduction of 26.6% across the several tasks of the BLUE (Biomedical Language Understanding Evaluation) Benchmark, while maintaining performance comparable with state-of-the-art models. The multi-task SVM configuration emerges as the most effective, demonstrating the power of combining IS with MTL for biomedical NLP. As a result of the unified framework, Blue5 effectively selects the most informative instances across tasks, ensuring model generalization while efficiently handling multiple NLP tasks.
Conclusion:
Our work offers a practical solution to address growing computational demands, enabling more scalable and accessible applications of advanced NLP techniques in biomedical research and healthcare.}

Comprehensive monolingual natural language processing (NLP) surveys are essential for assessing language-specific challenges, resource availability, and research gaps. However, existing surveys often lack standardized methodologies, leading to selection bias and fragmented coverage of NLP tasks and resources. This study introduces a generalizable framework for systematic monolingual NLP surveys. Our approach integrates a structured search protocol to minimize bias, an NLP task taxonomy for classification, and language resource taxonomies to identify potential benchmarks and highlight opportunities for improving resource availability. We apply this framework to Greek NLP (2012–2023), providing an in-depth analysis of its current state, task-specific progress, and resource gaps. The survey results are publicly available and are regularly updated to provide an evergreen resource. This systematic survey of Greek NLP serves as a case study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and its potential for broader application to other not-so-well-resourced languages as regards NLP.}

However, such global north unilateral strides have inadvertently created a substantial representation bias towards many languages categorized as low-resourced languages, with the majority being African languages. As a result, rudimentary resources such as stopwords, lemmatizers, stemmers, and word embeddings, as well as advanced multilingual transformer-based models remain under-developed for these languages. Compounding these circumstances is the lack of insights surrounding the development of these resources in the low-resourced context (e.g., how to develop embeddings for morphologically rich languages). Looking back, research priorities aiming to create these resources, largely motivated by the high cost attached to remedying these issues shifted, leading to the rise of alternative methods such as cross-lingual transfer learning (CLTL). CLTL involves transferring domain knowledge gained from supervised training to a domain with limited supervision signals. This study conducts a systematic literature review of CLTL techniques, in the context of cross-lingual models and embeddings, looking at their mathematical foundations, application domains, evaluation metrics, languages covered, and the latest developments. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the present scenario of CLTL techniques, identifying areas for future research and development to advance cross-lingual natural language processing applications specifically in low-resourced settings.}

This study proposes a novel generative approach to uncovering technology opportunities from patent maps using machine learning techniques. The proposed approach employs the embedding inversion technique, which restores high-dimensional embeddings to their original data form, to translate patent vacancies into human-readable texts. The process involves five steps: 1) transforming patent abstracts into high-dimensional vectors using a text embedding model, 2) training an autoencoder to project high-dimensional embeddings into a two-dimensional space and enable bidirectional mapping, 3) constructing a grid-based patent map using kernel density estimation, 4) identifying vacant cells and their coordinates as patent vacancies, and 5) reconstructing the vacancy coordinates into high-dimensional embedding vectors using the decoder, and generating human-readable texts using vec2text. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study on LiDAR technology was conducted using 17,616 collected patents. The results verified that the proposed approach can successfully identify patent vacancies and translate them into human-readable texts, which indicates its potential as a highly practical and useful instrument for technology opportunity analysis.}

Advanced persistent threats (APT) attacks are very low-frequency, hidden in network traffic, and it’s difficult to detect APT attacks with traditional detection methods. Therefore, this paper presents a Semantic Web-driven unsupervised detection framework for APT attacks in network traffic, leveraging Enhanced DBSCAN++ and aiNet algorithms. The proposed DBSCAN++ based aiNet clustering algorithm (D-aiNet) is firstly used for clustering the training samples on the extracted network traffic, and then generates a Self Set (Ss) and an Antibody Set (As). In the testing phase, an Immune Network based anomaly detection model (INAD) is employed to match network traffic samples from the selected dataset with antibodies of the Antibody Set (As) in order to detect APT attacks. To validate the effectiveness of UADDN, experimental studies were conducted using the SCVIC-APT-2021 dataset. Compared with UADAIN, and the other detection methods based on K-means clustering, aiNet-HC clustering, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UADDN shows superior performance in detecting APT attacks.}

abstract = {The rising influence of social media platforms in various domains, including tourism, has highlighted the growing need for efficient and automated Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies to take advantage of this valuable resource. However, the transformation of multilingual, unstructured, and informal texts into structured knowledge still poses significant challenges, most notably the never-ending requirement for manually annotated data to train deep learning classifiers. In this work, we study different NLP techniques to establish the best ones to obtain competitive performances while keeping the need for training annotated data to a minimum. To do so, we built the first publicly available multilingual dataset (French, English, and Spanish) for the tourism domain, composed of tourism-related tweets. The dataset includes multilayered, manually revised annotations for Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Locations and Fine-grained Thematic Concepts Extraction mapped to the Thesaurus of Tourism and Leisure Activities of the World Tourism Organization, as well as for Sentiment Analysis at the tweet level. Extensive experimentation comparing various few-shot and fine-tuning techniques with modern language models demonstrate that modern few-shot techniques allow us to obtain competitive results for all three tasks with very little annotation data: 5 tweets per label (15 in total) for Sentiment Analysis, 30 tweets for Named Entity Recognition of Locations and 1K tweets annotated with fine-grained thematic concepts, a highly fine-grained sequence labeling task based on an inventory of 315 classes. We believe that our results, grounded in a novel dataset, pave the way for applying NLP to new domain-specific applications, reducing the need for manual annotations and circumventing the complexities of rule-based, ad-hoc solutions.}

abstract = {The rapid development of social media in recent years has encouraged the sharing of vast amounts of data and the propagation of fake news. This has pushed the scientific community to focus on this phenomenon, particularly those working on natural language processing, by developing detection tools to combat fake news. At the same time, most studies have focused on languages with a high resource content (corpus). This paper aims to shed light on low-resource languages, particularly the Algerian dialect, through an experimental study with two objectives. The first one is to verify if the automatic translation from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to the Algerian dialect can be considered an approach to increase the resources in the Algerian dialect, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs). The second is to verify the impact of the translation-based data augmentation method on fake news detection by using transformer-based Arabic pre-trained models in different data augmentation configurations. We have discovered that LLMs can generate translations that closely resemble human translations. In this study, we demonstrate that data augmentation can result in saturation and a decline in model performance due to the introduction of noise and variations in writing styles.}

abstract = {This paper presents the FlowTransformer framework, a novel approach for implementing transformer-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs). FlowTransformer leverages the strengths of transformer models in identifying the long-term behaviour and characteristics of networks, which are often overlooked by most existing NIDSs. By capturing these complex patterns in network traffic, FlowTransformer offers a flexible and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners in the cybersecurity community who are seeking to implement NIDSs using transformer-based models. FlowTransformer allows the direct substitution of various transformer components, including the input encoding, transformer, classification head, and the evaluation of these across any flow-based network dataset. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the FlowTransformer framework, we utilise it to provide an extensive evaluation of various common transformer architectures, such as GPT 2.0 and BERT, on three commonly used public NIDS benchmark datasets. We provide results for accuracy, model size and speed. A key finding of our evaluation is that the choice of classification head has the most significant impact on the model performance. Surprisingly, Global Average Pooling, which is commonly used in text classification, performs very poorly in the context of NIDS. In addition, we show that model size can be reduced by over 50%, and inference and training times improved, with no loss of accuracy, by making specific choices of input encoding and classification head instead of other commonly used alternatives.}

However, with the advent of transformers and, in general, deep learning architectures, the field has dynamically shifted its focus towards customizing these architectures for various natural language processing tasks, including text classification problems. For a newcomer, it might be impossible to realize that for some text classification problems, the traditional approach is still competitive. This research analyzes the competitiveness of BoW-based representations in different text-classification competitions run in English, Spanish, and Italian. To analyze the performance of these BoW-based representations, we participated in 12 text classification international competitions, summing up 24 tasks comprising five English tasks, seven in Italian, and twelve in Spanish. The results show that the proposed BoW representations have a difference of just 10% w.r.t. the competition winner and less than 2% in three tasks corresponding to author profiling. BoW outperforms BERT solutions and dominates in author profiling tasks.}

To this end, this paper introduces the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention fusion model, which aims to fully extract the local and global features in the short text and improve the classification accuracy. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to extract local n-gram features and identify phrase patterns. Then, the global context information of the text is modeled by Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) to capture the influence of special structures such as auxiliary words and honorifics. Finally, the self-attention mechanism (Self-Attention) assigns weights to different words, so that the model focuses on the key information of classification and reduces the interference of grammatical vocabulary. In addition, Dropout regularization and Softmax classification layer are introduced to enhance the model’s robustness and capacity for adaptation. Experimental results show that the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model achieves the best performance in all structures, and the overall WOSS (Word Order Sensitivity Score) score is higher than other models. In the SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure, the model reaches 0.94, which is 20.5% higher than CNN’s 0.78, indicating that it has a more accurate understanding of standard word order sentences.}

As social media platforms change people’s lives and impacts the way they communicate and group themselves into virtual networks of like-minded individuals, the analysis of online content offers valuable insights of processes taking place on the Internet. Social data mining revolves around subjective content analysis, which deals with the computational processing of texts conveying people’s evaluations, beliefs, attitudes and emotions. Opinion mining and sentiment analysis are the main paradigm of social media exploration and both concepts are often interchangeable. This paper investigates the use of appraisal categories to explore data gleaned for social media and describes the construction of a formal model describing the way language is used in the cyberspace to evaluate, express mood and affective states, construct personal standpoints and manage interpersonal interactions. The ontology offers a mean to investigate subjective content going beyond the traditional notions of opinion and sentiment. Pitfalls of building a formal model for appraisal categories are examined and limitations of using the model for social data exploration are discussed.}

Traditional models, which are grounded in physical and numerical frameworks, provide robust explanations by explicitly reconstructing underlying physical processes. However, their limitations in comprehensively capturing Earth’s complexities and uncertainties pose challenges in optimization and real-world applicability. In contrast, contemporary data-driven models, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), leverage extensive geoscience data to glean insights without requiring exhaustive theoretical knowledge. ML techniques have shown promise in addressing Earth science-related questions. Nevertheless, challenges such as data scarcity, computational demands, data privacy concerns, and the “black-box” nature of AI models hinder their seamless integration into geoscience. The integration of physics-based and data-driven methodologies into hybrid models presents an alternative paradigm. These models, which incorporate domain knowledge to guide AI methodologies, demonstrate enhanced efficiency and performance with reduced training data requirements. This review provides a comprehensive overview of geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of AI in geoscience.

However, deep learning algorithms are sensitive to input data, and performance often deteriorates under nonstationary conditions and across dissimilar domains, especially when using time-domain data. Conventional single-channel or parallel multi-source data loading strategies either limit generalization or increase computational costs. This study introduces selective embedding, a novel data loading strategy, which alternates short segments of data from multiple sources within a single input channel. Drawing inspiration from cognitive psychology, selective embedding mimics human-like information processing to reduce model overfitting, enhance generalization, and improve computational efficiency. Validation is conducted using six time-domain datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method consistently achieves high classification accuracy for many deep learning architectures while significantly reducing training times. Across multiple datasets, selective embedding consistently improves test accuracy by 20 to 30 percent compared to traditional single-channel loading strategies, while also matching or exceeding the performance of parallel multi-source loading methods. Importantly, these gains are achieved while significantly reducing training times, demonstrating both efficiency and scalability across simple and complex architectures. The approach proves particularly effective for complex systems with multiple data sources, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for real-world applications in healthcare, heavy machinery, marine, railway, and agriculture, where robustness and adaptability are critical.}

abstract = {Information propagation analysis in Online Social Networks (OSNs) sparks great interest due to its impact across different business sectors. In the wide range of OSNs, the famous micro-blogging service Twitter stands out for a plethora of reasons, such as the platform popularity and the ease of access to data. Activities like retweeting in the popular OSN micro-blogging Twitter service, constitute fundamental mechanisms for information diffusion. The form of such cascading activities (like retweet) in time plays a crucial role in identifying the influence and the life duration of an information source (like tweet). In this paper, we propose an integral framework with a dual functionality to: (i) examine the effectiveness of robust mathematical models in the fitting of the curves produced by the number of retweets over a period of time, and (ii) employ these mathematical models to predict the behavior of the examined retweets using only a small fraction of them (as input data). The examined mathematical models stem from simple mathematical functions or are based on the Diffusion of Innovation theory, an important theory for examining spreading phenomena which has not yet been used thoroughly in OSNs Diffusion prediction. The proposed Framework (so called DIFCURV) encapsulates proper data preprocessing procedures as well as explanatory Analysis augmented with Visualization and Statistical Analysis. In the curve fitting part of the DIFCURV Framework, an optimization method, which depends upon the curve’s slope, is deployed to the tweet stories having an error above the defined threshold, resulting in a significant reduction of the error. To predict the retweets temporal evolution, the non-linear least squares curve-fitting method was selected after detailed exploration and examination of different methods. Furthermore, for the approximation of the growth-rate variable, three methods are proposed and Mean Growth Rate is showcased as the most suitable approach for the OSNs domain. The effectiveness of the DIFCURV Framework is exhibited by presenting results of several numerical experiments for a large dataset consisting of over two million retweets in total for all examined stories. DIFCURV prediction results were also compared with similar existing works and comparisons showed that the Proposed Framework can predict Information Diffusion with higher accuracy and efficiency.}

This paper presents a thorough survey of this discipline, emphasising the implications of human factors, the application of machine learning techniques, and the real-world deployments of these systems. In traditional manual negotiation, various challenges emerge, including limited negotiation skills, power asymmetries, personality disparities, and cultural influences. Automated negotiation systems can offer solutions to these challenges through their round-the-clock availability, the ability to negotiate without emotional bias, efficient information access, and seamless integration of cultural contexts. This comprehensive survey delves into the intricacies of human–computer negotiation, shedding light on the impact of emotional cues, cultural diversity, and the subtleties of language. Furthermore, the study reviews the incorporation of machine learning models that facilitate the adaptation of negotiation strategies. The paper also discusses the application of fuzzy set theory and fuzzy constraint methods within the scope of automated negotiation, providing a valuable addition to the existing literature. Real-world deployment of these systems in domains e.g., e-commerce, conflict resolution, and multi-agent systems is also examined. By providing a broad overview of automated negotiation, this survey acknowledges the vital role of human factors in negotiation processes, underscores the value of intelligent and adaptive negotiation techniques and offers valuable insights into the practical applications of these systems in various real-world contexts.}

Improvement was achieved by deep learning approaches for capturing user and product information from a short text. However, such previously used approaches do not fairly and efficiently incorporate users’ preferences and product characteristics. The proposed novel Hybrid Deep Collaborative Filtering (HDCF) model combines deep learning capabilities and deep interaction modeling with high performance for True Recommendations. To overcome the cold start problem, the new overall rating is generated by aggregating the Deep Multivariate Rating DMR (Votes, Likes, Stars, and Sentiment scores of reviews) from different external data sources because different sites have different rating scores about the same product that make confusion for the user to make a decision, either product is truly popular or not. The proposed novel HDCF model consists of four major modules such as User Product Attention, Deep Collaborative Filtering, Neural Sentiment Classifier, and Deep Multivariate Rating (UPA-DCF + NSC + DMR) to solve the addressed problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our novel model is outperforming state-of-the-art IMDb, Yelp2013, and Yelp2014 datasets for the true top-n recommendation of products using HDCF to increase the accuracy, confidence, and trust of recommendation services.}

This study proposes a fault diagnosis and improvement strategy that integrates the LDA topic model with the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology, carrying out in-depth analysis of failure factors in key processes on the production line and implementing a 12-week lean improvement initiative in a case enterprise. The results show that after these improvements, the production line's overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) increased significantly from 71 % to 84 %, with a marked reduction in equipment failure frequency, thereby ensuring enhanced production stability and reliability.

Sentiment analysis is a method that can be used to analyze people's behaviors and opinions on public and social media platforms. In this study, hotel reviews are extracted from the five most attractive Sri Lankan cities, and user-written reviews are compared over user bubble ratings, which define overall travelers' experiences as a numerical scale that ranks from 1 to 5. We find that the compatibility between user-written reviews and bubble ratings has a low correlation because bubble ratings may not represent the overall idea of users' genuine opinions expressed in their reviews. To address this problem, a two-phase approach is proposed: (1) the ensemble method to improve the performance of lexicon-based outputs and identify the correctly matching user review and bubble rating; (2) the self-learning approach to finding the sentiment of a review that does not properly label by the user. The performance is studied by considering reviews incompatible with the sentiment of user bubble rating and the sentiment generated by the proposed model. For example, regardless of bigram “not good”, the average percentages of the word “good” for each negatively identified review from the proposed model and bubble rating are 25.63% and 38.85%, respectively. Thereby, it is apparent that the negative sentiments derived by bubble rating have significantly more positive words compared to the proposed model.}

To address this limitation, we present a multimodal deep learning multi-modal fusion network CornMFN that synergistically integrates visual features from crop imagery with meteorological variables for corn phenology stage classification. The proposed architecture combines a ConvNeXt backbone for image feature extraction, MLP modules for processing structured weather data, and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse heterogeneous modalities. We constructed a rigorously curated dataset of 151,140 image-weather pairs spanning 10 phenological stages across three agro-ecological zones in China, incorporating spatiotemporally synchronized meteorological parameters. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CornMFN achieves 91.19 % classification accuracy, outperforming conventional image-only models by 6.91 % absolute improvement through effective multimodal fusion. Ablation studies quantify the cross-attention module's contribution to 5.39 % of the performance gain, while comparative analyses reveal superior robustness against environmental variabilities compared to unimodal approaches. These results establish that joint modeling of visual and meteorological features significantly enhances phenological recognition accuracy, particularly for transitional stages with minimal visual distinctions. The framework provides a deployable solution for precision agriculture while advancing multimodal learning methodologies through its novel fusion paradigm, with potential applications extending to other crop species and agricultural decision systems.}

abstract = {Linguistic metonymy is a common type of figurative language in natural language processing (NLP), where a concept is represented by a closely associated word or phrase, for example “business executives suits”. As a result, metonymy resolution has become an important NLP task aimed at correctly identifying metonymic expressions within sentences. Previous approaches to this task have typically relied on pre-trained language models (PLMs) using a fine-tuning process. However, this can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, and may lead to a loss of factual prior knowledge. The emergence of a novel learning paradigm termed “prompt learning” or “prompt-tuning” has recently sparked widespread interest and captured considerable attention, as it has proven to yield remarkable results and surpass previous benchmarks. This approach uses a “pre-train→prompt→predict” paradigm and has been shown to better utilize the internal prior knowledge of a PLM, especially in situations with limited supervised resources. Inspired by this success, we investigated how prompt learning could improve metonymy resolution. We have developed a series of prompt learning approaches, called PromptMR, for metonymy resolution, and applied them to several widely-used metonymy resolution datasets. We also designed additional prompt-tuning augmentation strategies to further enhance the potential of prompt learning. Our experiments demonstrated that our method achieved state-of-the-art performance over multiple competitive baselines in both data-sufficient and data-scarce scenarios. The code implementations for PromptMR are accessible on GitHub via the URL: https://github.com/albert-jin/PromptTuning2MetonymyResolution.}

Normally, such reviews are enriched with deep sentiments and express the opinions on various features of a product or service under consideration. Identification of a set of important domain features opens an opportunity to build automatic product and service summarization system. It is observed that the common phenomena is to consider the frequently appearing words as the domainb features. However, not all frequently appearing words can be domain-specific features. In this paper, a novel Domain Feature Miner (DOMINER) approach is proposed for robust extractive summarization. The entire domain feature set mining problem is modelled as a clustering problem. Firstly, the bond energy based clustering technique is employed to cluster the domain features based on their frequency and co-appearance counts. Later, relevant clusters are extracted for the final set of domain feature set retrieval. The Proposed DOMINER scheme is extensively evaluated against quantitative performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F-score for six diversified domains such as Cellphone, Camera, Laptop, Tablet, Television, and Hotel. Experimental results on benchmark data sets reveal that proposed DOMINER scheme mines high quality of domain feature from unstructured reviews evident from precision, recall, and F-score values as 78.10%, 64.21%, and 70.48%, respectively against state of the art existing schemes. The high quality domain features extraction from DOMINER help generate the robust extractive summaries for product and services.}

Our analysis establishes a phase-based framework spanning detection, tracking, analysis, and action, and reveals three critical gaps in current disaster management solutions: limited advancement beyond disaster response to include preparedness, recovery, and mitigation phases; insufficient integration across diverse stakeholder groups and available resources; and inadequate transformation of situation awareness data into actionable insights. Leveraging cross-modal semantic reasoning, knowledge graph-constrained entity extraction, and advanced code generation, LLMs are well positioned to overcome information ambiguity and verification challenges often encountered in rapidly evolving disaster contexts. These capabilities also enable automation in disaster investigation and communication, effectively orchestrating diverse analytical tools and resources. To harness these advantages and promote further progress, we introduce the “3M” framework for intelligent disaster information management: multi-modal data fusion for integrated assessment, multi-source information validation for robust truth-finding, and multi-agent collaboration in physical–virtual disaster systems.

This article presents an analysis that is based on the perspective of Marxist consumption theory. The exponential growth of e-commerce has heightened the problem of information overload, whereby consumers face excessive and complex information in the form of product listings, descriptions, and reviews. This overload frequently leads to hesitation, decision delays, and decreased satisfaction. Existing models often treat overload as either a cognitive or an emotional issue and thus fails to account for their combined impact. To address this gap, the authors propose the Multilayered Information Overload and Consumer Decision Behavior Model (MIO-CD), which is based on Marxist consumption theory. This research offers a scalable, evidence-based framework for understanding consumer decisions and provides actionable insights for optimizing digital commerce experiences.}

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding non-emergency city service requests from their residents. Big data analytics on these open big data can be for social good. Hence, in this article, we present a framework for predictive big data analytics for service requests. The framework mines historical open big data to discover patterns about service requests, and predicts the demands for these services in the future. The discovered knowledge and predictions may provide policy makers deeper understanding of their data and requested services so that appropriate actions could take place. Evaluation on open big data from the City of Winnipeg demonstrates the usefulness of our framework for conducting predictive big data analytics for service requests.}

Age is a crucial factor that influences individual differences in second language acquisition. The development of cognitive abilities also plays a significant role in second language learning, with the effects varying depending on whether this influence is positive or negative. This study explored the impact of age on knowledge sharing and management in big-data-driven English language teaching, aiming to optimize the teaching model of English wisdom classes. The paper proposes a detailed design tailored to different age groups, integrating relevant theories of intelligent classrooms and their teaching models. Additionally, the study parallelizes the improved k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to better suit the data processing requirements of cloud computing platforms. Upon parallelization, the enhanced k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is implemented on the Spark cloud platform, resulting in an approximately 10.3% increase in algorithm efficiency while maintaining classification accuracy.}

In this research, we demonstrate a general Data Extraction Framework Using Natural Language Processing (DEFNLP) Techniques which challenge data scientists to show how publicly funded data has been used to serve science and society. The proposed framework uses NLP libraries and techniques like SpaCy and NER respectively and different huggingface Question Answering (QA) models to predict the datasets used in publications. DEFNLP findings can assist the government in immediate decisions making, accountability, transparent public investments, economic and public health benefits. Until now such an issue having large dataset which belongs to numerous research areas has not been addressed. This approach is domain independent and therefore can be applied to all kind of case studies and scenarios which require data extraction. Our methodology sets the state-of-the-art on Coleridge Initiative dataset, reaching the highest score of 0.554 using salti bert QA model with the less runtime i.e. 417.4 and output of 819 bytes than other QA models e.g., Longformer (runtime: 2710.2, output: 1780 bytes) and BigBird (runtime: 839.4, output: 177020 bytes) with 0.444 and 0.387 score respectively which impressively raised the leaderboard score with an outcome of 0.711. Its computation time to answer each query on CPU is far less i.e. 0.0696s (than 0.3556s and 0.8967s) and has suitable hyperparameters for our dataset as maximum answer length is 64, greater batch size as well as learning rate. In terms of timing and performance, each epoch took around 5 min on average on a computer with output size of 3.27kB which is again far better than other frameworks.}

We obtain a high quality resource by implementing the proposed methodology for semi-automatic annotation, increasing annotator efficacy and speed, with fewer examples. The methodology consists of three incremental phases and results in the construction of the RUN dataset. The annotation quality of the resource was evaluated through time-reduction (annotation time reduction of almost 64% with respect to the fully manual annotation), annotation quality (measuring consistency of annotation and inter-annotator agreement), and performance by training a model with RUN semi-automatic dataset (Accuracy 95% F1 95%), validating the suitability of the proposal.}

abstract = {Background:
Few-shot learning (FSL) is a class of machine learning methods that require small numbers of labeled instances for training. With many medical topics having limited annotated text-based data in practical settings, FSL-based natural language processing (NLP) holds substantial promise. We aimed to conduct a review to explore the current state of FSL methods for medical NLP.
Methods:
We searched for articles published between January 2016 and October 2022 using PubMed/Medline, Embase, ACL Anthology, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. We also searched the preprint servers (e.g., arXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv) via Google Scholar to identify the latest relevant methods. We included all articles that involved FSL and any form of medical text. We abstracted articles based on the data source, target task, training set size, primary method(s)/approach(es), and evaluation metric(s).
Results:
Fifty-one articles met our inclusion criteria—all published after 2018, and most since 2020 (42/51; 82%). Concept extraction/named entity recognition was the most frequently addressed task (21/51; 41%), followed by text classification (16/51; 31%). Thirty-two (61%) articles reconstructed existing datasets to fit few-shot scenarios, and MIMIC-III was the most frequently used dataset (10/51; 20%). 77% of the articles attempted to incorporate prior knowledge to augment the small datasets available for training. Common methods included FSL with attention mechanisms (20/51; 39%), prototypical networks (11/51; 22%), meta-learning (7/51; 14%), and prompt-based learning methods, the latter being particularly popular since 2021. Benchmarking experiments demonstrated relative underperformance of FSL methods on biomedical NLP tasks.
Conclusion:
Despite the potential for FSL in biomedical NLP, progress has been limited. This may be attributed to the rarity of specialized data, lack of standardized evaluation criteria, and the underperformance of FSL methods on biomedical topics. The creation of publicly-available specialized datasets for biomedical FSL may aid method development by facilitating comparative analyses.}

The former first collects objective knowledge related to doctors and diseases to build a knowledge graph, then matches a group of healthcare services for patients according to the patient’s input; the latter selects five indicators from the doctor’s academic level, geographical location, public influence, reputation, etc. to build a TOPSIS model based on the entropy weight method to recommend the most appropriate healthcare services for patients.

However, success in scientific discovery tasks is limited by the accessibility of well-defined and labeled in-domain data. To tackle the low-data constraint, recent adaptions of deep learning models pretrained on millions of protein sequences have shown promise; however, the construction of such domain-specific large-scale models is computationally expensive. Herein, we propose representation reprogramming via dictionary learning (R2DL), an end-to-end representation learning framework in which we reprogram deep models for alternate-domain tasks that can perform well on protein property prediction with significantly fewer training samples. R2DL reprograms a pretrained English language model to learn the embeddings of protein sequences, by learning a sparse linear mapping between English and protein sequence vocabulary embeddings. Our model can attain better accuracy and significantly improve the data efficiency by up to 104 times over the baselines set by pretrained and standard supervised methods. To this end, we reprogram several recent state-of-the-art pretrained English language classification models (BERT, TinyBERT, T5, and roBERTa) and benchmark on a set of protein physicochemical prediction tasks (secondary structure, stability, homology, and solubility) as well as on a biomedically relevant set of protein function prediction tasks (antimicrobial, toxicity, antibody affinity, and protein–protein interaction).}

With the continuous improvement of international law, cross-border e-commerce platforms have been continuously developing and improving, becoming one of the main ways of international trade and economy. Online reviews substantially influence purchase decisions, yet their reliability is often eroded by manipulation, bias, and fraud. Prevailing methods depend mainly on sentiment analysis of review text, neglecting behavioral cues, probabilistic signals, and cross-platform variability. This study proposes the review credibility–trust integrated model—a comprehensive framework that unifies multi-dimensional credibility scoring, consumer trust formation, perceived risk estimation, and contextual factors (e.g., seller reputation, product category). The review credibility–trust integrated model synthesizes textual, behavioral, and probabilistic evidence to quantify review credibility and leverages structural equation modelling to disentangle the relationships among credibility, trust, risk perception, and purchase intention.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) products provide over-the-net capabilities such as remote activation, monitoring, and notifications. An associated mobile app is often provided for more convenient usage of these capabilities. The perceived quality of these companion apps can impact the success of the IoT product. We investigate the perceived quality and prominent issues of smart-home IoT mobile companion apps with the aim of deriving insights to: (i) provide guidance to end users interested in adopting IoT products; (ii) inform companion app developers and IoT producers about characteristics frequently criticized by users; (iii) highlight open research directions. We employ a mixed-methods approach, analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data. We assess the perceived quality of companion apps by quantitatively analyzing the star rating and the sentiment of 1,347,799 Android and 48,498 iOS user reviews. We identify the prominent issues that afflict companion apps by performing a qualitative manual analysis of 1,000 sampled reviews. Our analysis shows that users’ judgment has not improved over the years. A variety of functional and non-functional issues persist, such as difficulties in pairing with the device, software flakiness, poor user interfaces, and presence of issues of a socio-technical impact. Our study highlights several aspects of companion apps that require improvement in order to meet user expectations and identifies future directions.}

abstract = {Online hate speech has become a major social issue in recent years, affecting both individuals and society as a whole. Memes are a multimodal kind of internet hate speech that is growing more common. Online memes are often entertaining and harmless. The seemingly innocent meme, on the other hand, transforms into a multimodal form of hate speech—a hateful meme—when specific types of text, graphics, or combinations of both are used. The spread of these harmful or undesirable memes has the potential to disrupt societal peace. Therefore, it is vital to limit inappropriate memes on social media. Multimodal hate speech identification is an inherently difficult and open question. It necessitates collaborative language, visual perception, and multimodal reasoning. This line of research has been progressed in this work by building a multi-task learning-based multimodal system for detecting hateful memes by training four hateful meme data sets concurrently. This MTL framework, which consists of Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP), UNiversal Image-TExt Representation Learning (UNITER), and BERT, was trained collaboratively to transfer common knowledge while simultaneously training four meme datasets. The results show that the recommended strategy outperforms unimodal and multimodal approaches on four multilingual benchmark datasets, with considerable AUC-ROC, accuracy, and F1-score. The ablation studies are undertaken to emphasise the impact of the sub-component in the MTL model. The confusion matrix is shown as quantitative analysis.}

abstract = {Rapid urbanization, alongside escalating resource depletion and ecological degradation, underscores the urgent need for innovative paradigms in urban development. In response, sustainable smart cities are increasingly leveraging advanced technological frameworks—most notably the convergence of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)—as critical enablers for transforming their management and planning processes. Within this dynamic landscape, Urban Brain (UB) and Urban Digital Twin (UDT) have emerged as prominent AIoT-powered city platforms. Defined by their complex functionalities and multi-layered architectures, these systems exemplify Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS), offering a cohesive foundation for integrating real-time operational responsiveness with strategic predictive foresight. Despite notable technological progress, a critical gap persists in effectively integrating the distinct yet complementary capabilities of UB and UDT within a structured and scalable framework. To the best of our knowledge, research on the explicit fusion of UB's real-time analytics—enabled through stream processing—with UDT's predictive analytics—driven by simulation modeling—is scant, if not absent. Most existing studies continue to treat UB and UDT as siloed systems, failing to recognize the critical need to synchronize their respective operational and strategic functions. This fragmentation limits the ability of urban systems to respond both adaptively and proactively to the complex, interrelated challenges of environmental sustainability. To address this critical gap, this study introduces a novel foundational framework—Artificial Intelligence of Things for Sustainable Smart City Brain and Digital Twin Systems—designed to synergistically integrate UB and UDT as AIoT-enabled platforms within a unified CPSoS architecture. This framework addresses the critical disconnect between real-time operational management and strategic predictive planning, delivering an integrated pathway for advancing environmentally sustainable smart city development goals. Harnessing the complementary strengths of UB and UDT, it empowers cities to respond dynamically to immediate urban demands while ensuring consistent alignment with long-term sustainability goals. UB's real-time analytics enhance the efficiency of daily urban operations, whereas UDT's predictive modeling anticipates and simulates future scenarios. Together, they establish a synergistic feedback loop: UB's real-time insights continuously inform UDT's strategic simulations, while UDT's long-range forecasts iteratively refine UB's operational decision-making. The framework thus equips researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with a robust methodology for designing and implementing adaptive, efficient, and resilient urban ecosystems. It facilitates the development of intelligent urban environments that can advance environmental sustainability by integrating solid theoretical foundations with actionable strategies.}

abstract = {Researchers have been aware that emotion is not one-hot encoded in emotion-relevant classification tasks, and multiple emotions can coexist in a given sentence. Recently, several works have focused on leveraging a distribution label or a grayscale label of emotions in the classification model, which can enhance the one-hot label with additional information, such as the intensity of other emotions and the correlation between emotions. Such an approach has been proven effective in alleviating the overfitting problem and improving the model robustness by introducing a distribution learning component in the objective function. However, the effect of distribution learning cannot be fully unfolded as it can reduce the model’s discriminative ability within similar emotion categories. For example, “Sad” and “Fear” are both negative emotions. To address such a problem, we proposed a novel emotion extension scheme in the prior work (Li, Chen, Xie, Li, and Tao, 2021). The prior work incorporated fine-grained emotion concepts to build an extended label space, where a mapping function between coarse-grained emotion categories and fine-grained emotion concepts was identified. For example, sentences labeled “Joy” can convey various emotions such as enjoy, free, and leisure. The model can further benefit from the extended space by extracting dependency within fine-grained emotions when yielding predictions in the original label space. The prior work has shown that it is more apt to apply distribution learning in the extended label space than in the original space. A novel sparse connection method, i.e., Leaky Dropout, is proposed in this paper to refine the dependency-extraction step, which further improves the classification performance. In addition to the multiclass emotion classification task, we extensively experimented on sentiment analysis and multilabel emotion prediction tasks to investigate the effectiveness and generality of the label extension schema.}

abstract = {With the frequent occurrence of telecommunications and network fraud crimes in recent years, new frauds have emerged one after another which has caused huge losses to the people. However, due to the lack of an effective preventive mechanism, the police are often in a passive position. Using technologies such as web crawlers, feature engineering, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, this paper proposes a user portrait fraud warning scheme based on Weibo public data. First, we perform preliminary screening and cleaning based on the keyword “defrauded” to obtain valid fraudulent user Identity Documents (IDs). The basic information and account information of these users is user-labeled to achieve the purpose of distinguishing the types of fraud. Secondly, through feature engineering technologies such as avatar recognition, Artificial Intelligence (AI) sentiment analysis, data screening, and follower blogger type analysis, these pictures and texts will be abstracted into user preferences and personality characteristics which integrate multi-dimensional information to build user portraits. Third, deep neural network training is performed on the cube. 80% percent of the data is predicted based on the N-way K-shot problem and used to train the model, and the remaining 20% is used for model accuracy evaluation. Experiments have shown that Few-short learning has higher accuracy compared with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On this basis, this paper develops a WeChat small program for early warning of telecommunications network fraud based on user portraits. When the user enters some personal information on the front end, the back-end database can perform correlation analysis by itself, so as to match the most likely fraud types and give relevant early warning information. The fraud warning model is highly scaleable. The data of other Applications (APPs) can be extended to further improve the efficiency of anti-fraud which has extremely high public welfare value.}

The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) for graph sparsification is employed in the proposed approach to make it more time and memory efficient. The proposed work is further extended to determine the polarity of the opinion words associated with the identified aspect terms in review sentence to generate visual aspect-based summary of review documents. The experimental study is conducted on benchmark and crawled datasets of restaurant and laptop domains with varying value of labeled instances. The results depict that the proposed approach could achieve good result in terms of Precision, Recall and Accuracy with limited availability of labeled data.}

However, the detection performance is significantly reduced by the direct transfer due to the domain difference. Domain adaptation (DA) can transfer the distribution information from the source domain to the target domain and solve a series of problems caused by the distribution difference of data. In this survey, we review various current DA strategies combined with deep learning (DL) and analyze the principles, advantages, and disadvantages of each method.

The present research proposes a framework that integrates aspect-level sentiment analysis with multi-criteria decision making (TOPSIS) and control charts to uncover hidden quality patterns. While sentiment analysis quantifies consumer opinions corresponding to various product features, TOPSIS uses the sentiment scores to rank manufacturers based on their relative performance. Finally, U and P control charts assist in discovering the weak aspects and corresponding attributes. To extract aspect-level sentiments from reviews, the authors developed the ontology of passenger cars and designed a heuristic that connects the opinion-bearing texts to the exact automobile attribute. The proposed framework was applied to a review dataset collected from a well-known car portal in India. Considering five manufacturers from the mid-size car segment, the authors identified the weakest and discovered the aspects and attributes responsible for its perceived weakness.}

The literal sense is not difficult, but the figurative sense includes ideas like metaphors, similes, proverbs, and idioms to create a distinctive impact or imaginative description. Idioms are phrases whose meaning differs from that of the words that make up the phrase. Due to its non-compositional character, idiom detection in NLP tasks like text categorization is a significant difficulty. Inaccurate idiom recognition has reduced the model's performance in one of the crucial text categorization tasks, such as cyberbullying and sentiment analysis. Using language representation models that have already been trained, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformer) and RoBERTa, the current system categorises the phrases as literals or idioms (Robustly Optimised BERT Pretraining Approach). The current system performs more accurately than the baseline models. We propose a method for categorising idioms and literals is developed utilizing K-BERT (Knowledge-enabled BERT), a Deep Learning algorithm that injects knowledge-graphs (KGs) into the sentences as domain knowledge.

Since ontology construction from scratch is expensive and time consuming, the model is built by adapting an existing ontology modeling appraisal categories in English. The construction method consists of two main steps: first, the ontology of appraisals is translated in French by using a concept-to-concept approach; then different adaptation strategies are implemented to improve the result of this translation. Adaptation strategies are based on text mining, weakly supervised methods and the use of WordNet to refine the model. The goal of the adaptation phase is to cope with limitations of concept-to-concept translation, to integrate concepts and relations from external corpora and resources, and to build a model that captures various features of opinions. The ontology was designed and build to incorporate linguistic and extra linguistic information on the description of opinions in French. The model was validated by using both expert insights to validate the relevance of concepts and relations and formal criteria to describe the ontology qualities for practical use.}

CleanSheet is evaluated across a wide range of datasets CIFAR-10, AG News, SVHN, TinyImageNet, IMDB and MalNet-Tiny and models including ResNet-18, VGG-16, DenseNet-121, BERT, and GPT-3. It achieves an attack success rate of up to 96.2% on GPT-3 with the IMDB dataset while maintaining high accuracy on clean inputs. CleanSheet also bypasses advanced defenses such as ONION, input sanitization, and anomaly detection, consistently achieving over 89% attack success even under defense. We further analyze how factors like trigger size and type, dataset scale, training duration, and model complexity affect the attack’s performance.

abstract = {Infrastructure projects are by nature complicated and vulnerable due to unpredictable risks encountered during their execution. The use of expert opinion and qualitative methodologies in traditional risk identification makes them vulnerable to subjectivity and responsiveness, leading to cost overruns, delays, and, ultimately, project failure. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of risk identification, this study utilises historical data in conjunction with AI approaches to develop a data-driven risk identification model. The model determines risk frequency and consequence by matching them to different risk categories in previous projects, considering word semantics. This model also demonstrates the facilitation of proactive decision-making and allows infrastructure project team members to identify risks early and implement mitigation plans. The study also highlights the practical significance of utilising historical data to make risk management strategies for infrastructure projects more reliable and efficient.}

abstract = {To ensure good performance, modern machine learning models typically require large amounts of quality annotated data. Meanwhile, the data collection and annotation processes are usually performed manually, and consume a lot of time and resources. The quality and representativeness of curated data for a given task is usually dictated by the natural availability of clean data in the particular domain as well as the level of expertise of developers involved. In many real-world application settings it is often not feasible to obtain sufficient training data. Currently, data augmentation is the most effective way of alleviating this problem. The main goal of data augmentation is to increase the volume, quality and diversity of training data. This paper presents an extensive and thorough review of data augmentation methods applicable in computer vision domains. The focus is on more recent and advanced data augmentation techniques. The surveyed methods include deeply learned augmentation strategies as well as feature-level and meta-learning-based data augmentation techniques. Data synthesis approaches based on realistic 3D graphics modeling, neural rendering, and generative adversarial networks are also covered. Different from previous surveys, we cover a more extensive array of modern techniques and applications. We also compare the performance of several state-of-the-art augmentation methods and present a rigorous discussion of the effectiveness of various techniques in different scenarios of use based on performance results on different datasets and tasks.}

abstract = {Intelligent fault-diagnosis methods based on deep-learning technology have been very successful for complex industrial systems. The deep learning based fault classification model requires a large number of labeled data. Moreover, the probability distribution of training set and test data should be the same. These two conditions are often not satisfied in practical working conditions. Thereby an intelligent fault-diagnosis method based on a deep adversarial transfer network is proposed, when the target domain only has unlabeled samples. The Wasserstein distance is used as a metric to learn a domain-independent feature through the adversarial training between the generator and the domain discriminator. Meanwhile, a reasonable loss function of fault classification is designed, which can ensure that the learned feature does not contain domain information, but also contains fault classification information. Finally the cross-domain fault classification can be solved, even if there is no labeled vibration data in the target domain. The experimental results show that in transfer tasks under different working conditions, the fault classification accuracy exceeds 90%, which is approximately 10% higher than that of the comparison method.}

Due to such large-scale use cases, selection of these models is of primary importance while developing cyber physical systems. But mining models are highly variant in terms of their internal performance characteristics, which makes it difficult for researchers to identify optimum models for their application-specific & performance-specific deployments. Moreover, these data mining models also vary in terms of their internal qualitative & quantitative performance measures. These measures include, precision, accuracy, recall, sensitivity, deployment cost, computational complexity, scalability, etc. Due to such a wide variation in performance, it is ambiguous for researchers to identify optimum models for their application deployments. To reduce this ambiguity, a comparison of these models in terms of their performance-level nuances, function advantages, deployment-specific limitations, and context-specific future scopes is described in this text. Researchers will be able to identify optimum models for their functional-specific deployments. It was observed that Neural Network (NN) based models including Convolutional NNs, Region based NNs, Recurrent NNs, etc. showcased better functional characteristics when compared with linear mining models for large-scale use cases. To further simplify model selection, this text compared the underlying models in terms of their performance metrics including accuracy, complexity, scalability, etc. Depending on this performance-specific evaluation, it was observed that bioinspired models when combined with deep learning techniques can outperform existing models for multiple application scenarios. This will further allow readers to identify optimum models based on their performance-specific characteristics. This text also evaluates a novel Mining Scalability Metric (MSM), which combines primary & secondary performance measures, and assists in identification of mining techniques that have higher accuracy, with lower complexity, and faster response, thereby reducing the ambiguity of model selection process.}

They analyze user interactions, such as ratings, to identify user preferences and recommend relevant items accordingly. The sparsity of user–item rating data poses a significant obstacle for Recommender Systems, making it difficult to model user preferences effectively. This issue is particularly evident in collaborative filtering techniques, where the accuracy of user/item similarity calculations and latent factor identification are compromised. Therefore, the sparsity adversely affects the accuracy, coverage, scalability, and transparency of the recommendations, posing significant challenges. Various approaches have been developed to estimate sparse values from the available ratings and improved user/item profiles with side information or sparse ratings to improve the estimation by addressing the four challenges. Despite extensive research in this area, there is a lack of comprehensive surveys that specifically explore estimation methods using sparse rating data and profile enrichment techniques focusing on overcoming challenges that occur due to sparsity such as reduced coverage, transparency, scalability, and accuracy. Understanding the effectiveness of these approaches, their impact on recommendations and future research directions is a crucial area of the literature. This study seeks to examine the individual effects of rating-based estimation and profile enrichment-based estimation methods in Collaborative Filtering recommender systems, to address challenges related to sparsity, identify research gaps, and suggest future research directions. It also provides readers with information on methodologies, available datasets with varying levels of sparsity, and ongoing research challenges in this field.}

To address these challenges, this paper presents an integrated deep learning architecture: the Feature Fusion and Multi-Graph Fusion Learning Framework (CGCN-FMF). The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Feature Fusion Network designed to extract essential features from multiple views, and (2) a Multi-Graph Fusion Network that constructs multiple graphs for each view and optimizes both the graph weights and the GCN model. Experimental results from multiple multi-view datasets show that CGCN-FMF outperforms state-of-the-art methods on semi-supervised multi-view classification tasks.}

To address this, our study presents a Personalized Adaptive Multi-Product Recommendation System (PAMR) leveraging transfer learning and Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units). Using a large dataset of user reviews from Amazon and Flipkart, we employ transfer learning with pre-trained models (AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet-50) to extract high-level attributes from product data, ensuring effective feature representation even with limited data. Bi-GRU captures both spatial and sequential dependencies in user-item interactions. The innovation of this study lies in the innovative feature fusion technique that combines the strengths of multiple transfer learning models, and the integration of an attention mechanism within the Bi-GRU framework to prioritize relevant features. Our approach addresses the classic recommendation systems that often face challenges such as cold start along with data sparsity difficulties, by utilizing robust user and item representations. The model demonstrated an accuracy of up to 96.9%, with precision and an F1-score of 96.2% and 96.97%, respectively, on the Amazon dataset, significantly outperforming the baselines and marking a considerable advancement over traditional configurations.

abstract = {With the rapid spread of Internet information and the spread of fake news, the detection of fake news becomes more and more important. Traditional detection methods often rely on a single emotional or semantic feature to identify fake news, but these methods have limitations when dealing with news in specific domains. In order to solve the problem of weak feature correlation between data from different domains, a model for detecting fake news by integrating domain-specific emotional and semantic features is proposed. This method makes full use of the attention mechanism, grasps the correlation between different features, and effectively improves the effect of feature fusion. The algorithm first extracts the semantic features of news text through the Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) layer to capture the contextual relevance of news text. Senta-BiLSTM is then used to extract emotional features and predict the probability of positive and negative emotions in the text. It then uses domain features as an enhancement feature and attention mechanism to fully capture more fine-grained emotional features associated with that domain. Finally, the fusion features are taken as the input of the fake news detection classifier, combined with the multi-task representation of information, and the MLP and Softmax functions are used for classification. The experimental results show that on the Chinese dataset Weibo21, the F1 value of this model is 0.958, 4.9% higher than that of the sub-optimal model; on the English dataset FakeNewsNet, the F1 value of the detection result of this model is 0.845, 1.8% higher than that of the sub-optimal model, which is advanced and feasible.}

abstract = {Background
Suicide is a serious public health issue, accounting for 1.4% of all deaths worldwide. Current risk assessment tools are reported as performing little better than chance in predicting suicide. New methods for studying dynamic features in electronic health records (EHRs) are being increasingly explored. One avenue of research involves using sentiment analysis to examine clinicians’ subjective judgments when reporting on patients. Several recent studies have used general-purpose sentiment analysis tools to automatically identify negative and positive words within EHRs to test correlations between sentiment extracted from the texts and specific medical outcomes (eg, risk of suicide or in-hospital mortality). However, little attention has been paid to analyzing the specific words identified by general-purpose sentiment lexicons when applied to EHR corpora.
Objective
This study aims to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the coverage of six general-purpose sentiment lexicons against a corpus of EHR texts to ascertain the extent to which such lexical resources are fit for use in suicide risk assessment.
Methods
The data for this study were a corpus of 198,451 EHR texts made up of two subcorpora drawn from a 1:4 case-control study comparing clinical notes written over the period leading up to a suicide attempt (cases, n=2913) with those not preceding such an attempt (controls, n=14,727). We calculated word frequency distributions within each subcorpus to identify representative keywords for both the case and control subcorpora. We quantified the relative coverage of the 6 lexicons with respect to this list of representative keywords in terms of weighted precision, recall, and F score.
Results
The six lexicons achieved reasonable precision (0.53-0.68) but very low recall (0.04-0.36). Many of the most representative keywords in the suicide-related (case) subcorpus were not identified by any of the lexicons. The sentiment-bearing status of these keywords for this use case is thus doubtful.
Conclusions
Our findings indicate that these 6 sentiment lexicons are not optimal for use in suicide risk assessment. We propose a set of guidelines for the creation of more suitable lexical resources for distinguishing suicide-related from non–suicide-related EHR texts.}

This paper presents an unexploited opportunity for formal educational institutions to integrate MOOCs into their curricula by guiding and supporting learners on these platforms. It introduces a Deep Semantic MOOC Recommender System (DSMRS) designed to help learners choose MOOCs aligned with their formal curriculum. The system utilizes advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to deliver personalized recommendations to learners. It employs a top-N recommender algorithm and leverages three key strategies: (a) an optimized Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) to measure semantic similarity between course descriptions and learning objectives; (b) Sentiment Analysis, using a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model to analyze learner reviews of MOOCs; and (c) Classification of Recommended MOOCs based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, categorizing MOOCs according to cognitive complexity. The results highlight that experimentation conducted with the system demonstrates promising performance.}

A cross-language attribute-level sentiment analysis model (TinyBERT-GCN) based on TinyBERT and GCN is proposed to address the problems of existing cross-language attribute-level sentiment analysis methods, such as insufficient text feature extraction and easy to ignore cross-language semantic correlations at the word level. The model extracts contextual semantics through TinyBERT, fuses multilingual features using the Multi-Granular Interaction Module, and enhances the understanding of text syntax using GCN. The experimental results show that the proposed TinyBERT-GCN model can achieve ACC and F1 of 0.871 and 0.812 on SemEVAL-2016 dataset; and 0.848 and 0.821 on Taobao dataset, and 0.863 and 0.802 on SemEVAL-2014 dataset respectively. Compared with the other models, the proposed model not only improves the performance, but also reduces the computational cost, has better scalability, and is suitable for large-scale multilingual data processing. This model has important practical applications in market analysis, public opinion monitoring and decision making.}

Recent artificial intelligence (AI) advancements offer promising solutions to enhance risk management. This systematic literature review (SLR) explores the integration of AI in construction risk management, focusing on AI applications, risk categories, and key algorithms. A total of 84 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024 were analysed. The SLR method involved rigorous identification, selection, and critical appraisal of studies, followed by bibliometric analysis to uncover research trends, influential authors, and thematic clusters. The bibliometric analysis, including keyword co-occurrence and author collaboration networks, provided insights into the structure of the research landscape. Findings revealed that AI methods such as machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), knowledge-based reasoning (KBR), optimisation algorithm (OA), and computer vision (CV) play crucial roles in predicting and managing risks. ML is employed for predictive modelling, NLP for document and compliance risk management, KBR for decision support, OA for optimising resources and schedules, and CV for real-time safety monitoring. Despite advancements, challenges related to data quality, model interpretability, and workforce skills hinder full AI integration. Future research should explore AI’s intersection with emerging technologies such as blockchain and adaptive risk models for responsible adoption. This paper contributes to the growing knowledge of AI’s transformative impact on construction risk management.}

We propose TopicStriKer, a model combining the advantages of unsupervised topic modeling with supervised string kernels for text classification tasks. The co-occurring topic words per topic and topic proportions per document obtained are used to reduce the document corpus to a topic-word sequence. This reduced representation is then used for text classification with the aid of string kernels, significantly improving accuracy and reducing training time. Experiments on the bag-of-words kernel-based string embeddings using the proposed algorithm outperform the traditional text classification approaches.

abstract = {Online reviews significantly impact consumers who are purchasing or seeking services via the Internet. Businesses and review platforms need to manage these online reviews to avoid misleading customers through fake ones. This necessitates developing intelligent solutions to detect these fake reviews and prevent their negative impact on businesses and customers. Therefore, many fake review detection models have been proposed to help distinguish fake reviews from genuine ones. However, these techniques depend on a limited perspective of features, mainly review content, to detect fake reviews, leading to poor performance in discovering the new patterns of fake review content and the dynamic behaviour of spammers. Therefore, there is still a need to develop new solutions to detect the new patterns of fake reviews. Hence, this paper proposes an explainable multi-view deep learning model to identify fake reviews based on different feature perspectives and classifiers. The proposed model can extract essential features from different perspectives, including review content, reviewer data, and product description. Moreover, we employ an ensemble approach that combines three popular deep learning algorithms: Bi-LSTM, CNN, and DNN, to enhance the performance of the fake review detection model. The results of two real-life datasets presented demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed model, where it outperformed the state-of-the-art methods with improvements ranging from 1% to 7% in terms of the AUC metric. To provide visibility into the outcomes of our proposed model and demonstrate the trust and transparency in the obtained results, we also offer a comprehensive explanation for our model results using Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) method and attention techniques. The experimental results prove that our proposed model can provide reasonable explanations that help users understand why specific reviews are classified as fake.}

Specifically, with the advantage of data-driven methods, industrial organizations are seeking novel proactive strategies supported by analytic models to guarantee the quality of their production by observing degradation or predicting failure ahead of the occurrence of the component or asset. Predictive strategies are expected to promise the influence of unnecessary maintenance interruptions and mitigate the consequence of that, hence, extending the remaining useful life of products. This paper conducts a survey of the utilization of deep learning technologies on engineering applications where they provide satisfactory solutions with respect to specific data types or input signals. 106 primary papers are reviewed on deep learning–driven approaches which mainly explore five of the most popular architectures in the application of predictive maintenance. The main content of this paper summarizes the common advantages of each architecture and, accordingly, points out their limitations, as well as describes the application scopes of fully connected deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks, stacked autoencoders, deep belief networks, and deep recurrent neural networks. Based on the technique discussion for each of them, we intend to provide a comprehensive understanding and guidance of the appropriate usage of deep learning architectures to devise an effective predictive maintenance strategy for the scientific and industrial developers whose expertise lies in the prior domain knowledge of multi-source isomerization data. Moreover, the main content demonstrated the summarization of the decisive factor by which the incremental stages of the approaches were determined, fundamentally including the dataset specification, feature extraction, and the integration of deep learning approaches.}

Because of its concealment and ease of manipulation, related-party transactions (RPTs) among firms have become a usual way to implement financial fraud. However, the traditional quantitative analysis methods regard each firm as an independent individual, failing to mine the intricate relation and transactions among related parties. A knowledge graph can mine valuable hidden knowledge from large-scale associated data as a new form of knowledge representation. Therefore, in this paper, the RPT knowledge graph is utilized to detect financial fraud, where the feature of the transaction’s scale and category is obtained. The experiment on the Chinese listed companies from 2000 to 2019 shows that these features enhance financial fraud detection performance, suggesting that type, size, and frequency of RPTs may imply fraud. More details, the feature importance indicates that regulators should pay more attention to the loan-based RPTs and the total number of RPTs.}

abstract = {In the digital era, threat actors employ sophisticated techniques for which, often, digital traces in the form of textual data are available. Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is related to all the solutions inherent to data collection, processing, and analysis useful to understand a threat actor’s targets and attack behavior. Currently, CTI is assuming an always more crucial role in identifying and mitigating threats and enabling proactive defense strategies. In this context, NLP, an artificial intelligence branch, has emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing threat intelligence capabilities. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of NLP-based techniques applied in the context of threat intelligence. It begins by describing the foundational definitions and principles of CTI as a major tool for safeguarding digital assets. It then undertakes a thorough examination of NLP-based techniques for CTI data crawling from Web sources, CTI data analysis, Relation Extraction from cybersecurity data, CTI sharing and collaboration, security threats of CTI, and role of LLM in this domain. Finally, the challenges and limitations of NLP in threat intelligence are exhaustively examined, including data quality issues and ethical considerations. This survey draws a complete framework and serves as a valuable resource for security professionals and researchers seeking to understand the state-of-the-art NLP-based threat intelligence techniques and their potential impact on cybersecurity.}

abstract = {In the current state of the field of machine learning, often, real-world phenomena are learned through studies of isolated modalities; such as modeling language exclusively from verbal modality, which is a common theme in natural language processing. This is widely adopted since downstream tasksin different disciplines of machine learning are also often similarly isolated and unimodal. In sharp contrast to this, human learning from real-world experiences is rarely unimodal, and often exhibits a multisensory nature, regardless of any assumptions about downstream tasks. The cognitive constructs in human brain are consistently developed through multisensory reinforcement, and the same constructs generalize to unimodal scenarios. The difference between the trend of unimodal learning and human cognitive development raises the following question: “Even if downstream tasks are unimodal during test time, is it better to learn from the isolated modality or from multimodal information?”. In this paper we focus on an in-depth study of this research question. We study the differences between unimodal learning and Multimodal Co-learning (MCl), both from empirical and theoretical standpoints. Through the lens of information entropy and characteristics of deep neural networks, we demonstrate strong theoretical justifications in favor of MCl.}

The state-of-the-art solutions for DID are built on various deep neural networks that commonly learn the representation of sentences in response to a given dialect. Despite the effectiveness of these solutions, the performance heavily relies on the amount of labeled examples, which is labor-intensive to attain and may not be readily available in real-world scenarios. To alleviate the burden of labeling data, this paper introduces a novel solution that leverages unlabeled corpora to boost performance on the DID task. Specifically, we design an architecture that enables learning the shared information between labeled and unlabeled texts through a gradient reversal layer. The key idea is to penalize the model for learning source dataset-specific features and thus enable it to capture common knowledge regardless of the label. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution on benchmark datasets for DID. Our extensive experiments show that it performs significantly better, especially, with sparse labeled data. By comparing our approach with existing Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in the DID field.

abstract = {Loss functions are essential to computing the divergence of a model’s predicted distribution from the ground truth. Such functions play a vital role in machine learning algorithms as they steer the learning process. Most common loss functions in natural language processing (NLP), such as Kullback–Leibler (KL) and Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergences, do not base their computations on the properties of label coordinates. Label coordinates can help encode the inter-label relationships. For the sentiment classification task, strongly positive sentiment is closer to positive than strongly negative sentiment. Incorporating such information in the computations of the probability divergence can facilitate the model’s learning dynamics. In this work, we study an under-explored loss function in NLP — Wasserstein Optimal Transport (OT) — which takes label coordinates into account and thus allows the learning algorithm to incorporate inter-label relations. However, the limited applications of OT-based loss owe to the challenges in defining quality label coordinates. We explore the current limitations of learning with OT and provide an algorithm that jointly learns label coordinates with the model parameters. We show the efficacy of OT on several text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in conversation. We also discuss the limitations of the approach.

In the digital and computing world, information is generated and collected at a rate that quickly exceeds the boundaries. The traditional data integration system interconnects the limited number of resources and is built with relatively stable and generally complex and time-consuming design activities. However, the rapid growth of these large data sets creates difficulties in learning heterogeneous data structures for integration and indexing. It also creates difficulty in information retrieval for the various data analysis requirements. In this paper, a probabilistic feature Patterns (PFP) approach using feature transformation and selection method is proposed for efficient data integration and utilizing the features latent semantic analysis (F-LSA) method for indexing the unsupervised multiple heterogeneous integrated cluster data sources. The PFP approach takes the advantage of the features transformation and selection mechanism to map and cluster the data for the integration, and an analysis of the data features context relation using LSA to provide the appropriate index for fast and accurate data extraction. A huge volume of BibText dataset from different publication sources are processed to evaluated to understand the effectiveness of the proposal. The analytical study and the outcome results show the improvisation in integration and indexing of the work.}

abstract = {A complete examination of Large Language Models’ strengths, problems, and applications is needed due to their rising use across disciplines. Current studies frequently focus on single-use situations and lack a comprehensive understanding of LLM architectural performance, strengths, and weaknesses. This gap precludes finding the appropriate models for task-specific applications and limits awareness of emerging LLM optimization and deployment strategies. In this research, 50 studies on 25+ LLMs, including GPT-3, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, DeepKet, and hybrid multimodal frameworks like ContextDET and GeoRSCLIP, are thoroughly reviewed. We propose LLM application taxonomy by grouping techniques by task focus—healthcare, chemistry, sentiment analysis, agent-based simulations, and multimodal integration. Advanced methods like parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), quantum-enhanced embeddings (DeepKet), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and safety-focused models (GalaxyGPT) are evaluated for dataset requirements, computational efficiency, and performance measures. Frameworks for ethical issues, data limited hallucinations, and KDGI-enhanced fine-tuning like Woodpecker’s post-remedy corrections are highlighted. The investigation’s scope, mad, and methods are described, but the primary results are not. The work reveals that domain-specialized fine-tuned LLMs employing RAG and quantum-enhanced embeddings perform better for context-heavy applications. In medical text normalization, ChatGPT-4 outperforms previous models, while two multimodal frameworks, GeoRSCLIP, increase remote sensing. Parameter-efficient tuning technologies like LoRA have minimal computing cost and similar performance, demonstrating the necessity for adaptive models in multiple domains. To discover the optimum domain-specific models, explain domain-specific fine-tuning, and present quantum and multimodal LLMs to address scalability and cross-domain issues. The framework helps academics and practitioners identify, adapt, and innovate LLMs for different purposes.

We discovered that the sentiment of tweets differs between migrants and stayers over time, and it relates to the country of migration. The general sentiment is similar for migrants and stayers, but a more detailed analysis reveals that hashtags related to staying safe and staying at home, as well as vaccinations are more polarised for migrants than for stayers, and they reflect the general development trend of the pandemic in Europe. In addition to comparing migrants with stayers, we also compared migrants staying in different countries. amongst the countries of migration, for which we collected at least 3000 tweets, the most positive sentiment of Polish migrants’ tweets was observed in Belgium, with the most negative sentiment coming from Estonia. We also observed that the sentiment of tweets written in Polish by stayers in Poland is less negative when compared to Polish migrants in most of the countries with the highest number of tweets.}

Traditional deep learning models for text sentiment analysis fail to fully harness the contextual semantic information of aspect nodes or use prior sentiment resources. This paper proposes a dual channel sentiment analysis model named M2BERT-BLSTM AA that is based on an enhanced Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT)and Bidirectional Long short-term memory(BLSTM) model and incorporates a Dual Attention Mechanism. Firstly, an emotional resource database is constructed using existing emotional resources. Secondly, vectors are concatenated following mean and max pooling along the dimension of sentence length. These semantic features mitigate evaluation imbalance.Then the text and sentiment information are encoded separately, using distinct Attention Mechanism(Att-M) to extract contextual relationships and emotional features. The model's Aspect-Based multi-class sentiment prediction accuracies on the three Chinese datasets of Meituan ordering, restaurants, and laptops are 75.2%, 87.5%, and 75%, respectively, showing improved performance on sentiment classification.}

This content mainly involves offensive/discriminative speech towards social groups or individuals (based on racial, religious, gender or other characteristics) and could possibly lead into subsequent hate actions/crimes due to persistent escalation. Content management and moderation in big data volumes can no longer be supported manually. In the current research, a web framework is presented and evaluated for the collection, analysis, and aggregation of multilingual textual content from various online sources. The framework is designed to address the needs of human users, journalists, academics, and the public to collect and analyze content from social media and the web in Spanish, Italian, Greek, and English, without prior training or a background in Computer Science. The backend functionality provides content collection and monitoring, semantic analysis including hate speech detection and sentiment analysis using machine learning models and rule-based algorithms, storing, querying, and retrieving such content along with the relevant metadata in a database. This functionality is assessed through a graphic user interface that is accessed using a web browser. An evaluation procedure was held through online questionnaires, including journalists and students, proving the feasibility of the use of the proposed framework by non-experts for the defined use-case scenarios.}

This paper aims to estimate – at the quantitative and qualitative levels – the possibility of using particular words to disambiguate between truthful and deceptive text, focusing on reviews produced in the cultural heritage domain. For this purpose, a lexicon-based methodology has used two different lexicons: sentiment information, intensifiers, downtoners, and negation operators. As known in the literature, these elements are crucial in a classification process related to deceptiveness. The evaluation phase has considered quantitative metrics such as accuracy and F1 score and ad hoc developed metrics that consider specific linguistic parameters such as polarity and tone of voice intensifiers. A qualitative analysis of a subset of the corpus has also been carried out to understand better factors that impact the classification of deceptive review. Several linguistic features have been considered, ranging from the number of intensifiers to their type and position in phrases and sentences. A comparison between the performances of two different lexicons used has been added to the analysis.}

abstract = {This paper posits and tests a social cybersecurity framework to detect and characterize online trolling. Using a dataset of online trolling obtained through active learning, we empirically find that troll messages are significantly associated with more abusive language (p<.001), lower cognitive complexity (p<.01), and greater targeting of named entities (p<.05) and identities (p<.05). These effects are robust to the likelihood that these messages come from bots. We then train and evaluate TrollHunter, a theory-driven and interpretable machine learning model using the derived psycholinguistic features. TrollHunter achieves 89% accuracy and F1 score in detecting trolling messages, with an average 12.25% improvement in performance when relationally modeling conversational context. Explorations of convergent and discriminant validity reveal that our measure of trolling is more closely related to non-hateful offensive speech over hate speech, aggressive over non-aggressive speech, and that Chinese state-sponsored accounts engage in higher levels of trolling than Russian state-sponsored accounts (p<.001). Finally, we apply TrollHunter in a field study to compare the media targets of trolling activity compared to bots as a reference group. Bots dominate replies to exclusive right-leaning media outlets like Breitbart and Newsmax, while trolls disproportionately target outlets with mixed partisan trust like BBC and ABC. This bifurcation suggests that not only are trolls and bots different entities, but they also have different impacts in relation to driving polarization and disinformation in society. Echoing recent calls for interdisciplinary approaches that link computational models with social theory, we conclude with implications for platform regulation and policy-making to curtail the actions of diverse agents of disinformation.}

abstract = {Language models exhibit a profound aptitude for addressing multimodal and multidomain challenges, a competency that eludes the majority of off-the-shelf machine learning models. Consequently, language models hold great potential for comprehending the intricate interplay between material compositions and diverse properties, thereby accelerating material design, particularly in the realm of polymers. While past limitations in polymer data hindered the use of data-intensive language models, the growing availability of standardized polymer data and effective data augmentation techniques now opens doors to previously uncharted territories. Here, we present a revolutionary model to enable rapid and precise prediction of Polymer properties via the power of Natural language and Chemical language (PolyNC). To showcase the efficacy of PolyNC, we have meticulously curated a labeled prompt–structure–property corpus encompassing 22 970 polymer data points on a series of essential polymer properties. Through the use of natural language prompts, PolyNC gains a comprehensive understanding of polymer properties, while employing chemical language (SMILES) to describe polymer structures. In a unified text-to-text manner, PolyNC consistently demonstrates exceptional performance on both regression tasks (such as property prediction) and the classification task (polymer classification). Simultaneous and interactive multitask learning enables PolyNC to holistically grasp the structure–property relationships of polymers. Through a combination of experiments and characterizations, the generalization ability of PolyNC has been demonstrated, with attention analysis further indicating that PolyNC effectively learns structural information about polymers from multimodal inputs. This work provides compelling evidence of the potential for deploying end-to-end language models in polymer research, representing a significant advancement in the AI community's dedicated pursuit of advancing polymer science.}

Recognizing the challenges posed by class imbalance and complex customer behaviors, we employ multiple ensemble techniques to build a robust predictive framework. Our analysis demonstrates that stacking models achieve the best overall performance, with an accuracy of 91.88% and an Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) score of 0.9491, indicating a strong capability to differentiate between subscribers and non-subscribers. Additionally, feature importance analysis reveals that contact duration, economic indicators like the Euro interbank offered (Euribor) rate, and customer age are the most influential factors in predicting subscription likelihood. These findings suggest that by focusing on customer engagement and economic trends, banks can improve telemarketing campaign effectiveness. We recommend the integration of advanced balancing techniques and real-time prediction systems to further enhance model performance and adaptability. Future work could explore deep learning models and interpretability techniques to gain deeper insights into customer behavior patterns. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ensemble models in predictive modeling for telemarketing, providing a data-driven foundation for more targeted and efficient customer acquisition strategies.}

In the semantic word extraction process, the semantic words from the dictionary will be extracted by matching with the extracted keywords. The next process is the feature extraction, which extracts joint holoentropy and cross holoentropy of all keywords, and further proceeds with conditional holoentropy-based feature selection process. Finally, the selected features are subjected to a classification process using Deep Belief Network (DBN), which is a well-performing deep learning algorithm. Moreover, the main contribution of the paper relies on the improvement of DBN architecture, where the number of hidden neurons and activation function is optimally tuned by a hybrid optimization algorithm termed as Grey linked Chick Update-based Chicken Swarm Optimization (GCU-CSO).

Fake news detection is typically a classification problem aiming at verifying the veracity of news contents, which may include texts, images and videos. This article provides a comprehensive survey of fake news detection. We first summarize three intrinsic characteristics of fake news by analyzing its entire diffusion process, namely intentional creation, heteromorphic transmission, and controversial reception. The first refers to why users publish fake news, the second denotes how fake news propagates and distributes, and the last means what viewpoints different users may hold for fake news. We then discuss existing fake news detection approaches according to these characteristics. Thus, this review will enable readers to better understand this field from a new perspective. We finally discuss the trends of technological advances in this field and also outline some potential directions for future research.}

abstract = {Summary
Balancing prediction accuracy, model interpretability, and domain generalization (also known as [a.k.a.] out-of-distribution testing/evaluation) is a central challenge in machine learning. To assess this challenge, we took 120 interpretable and 166 opaque models from 77,640 tuned configurations, complemented with ChatGPT, 3 probabilistic language models, and Vec2Read. The models first performed text classification to derive principles of textual complexity (task 1) and then generalized these to predict readers’ appraisals of processing difficulty (task 2). The results confirmed the known accuracy-interpretability trade-off on task 1. However, task 2’s domain generalization showed that interpretable models outperform complex, opaque models. Multiplicative interactions further improved interpretable models’ domain generalization incrementally. We advocate for the value of big data for training, complemented by (1) external theories to enhance interpretability and guide machine learning and (2) small, well-crafted out-of-distribution data to validate models—together ensuring domain generalization and robustness against data shifts.}

With the rapid adoption of smart farming technologies and infrastructure, the agricultural sector has become an attractive target for cyberattacks. This paper presents a systematic literature review that assesses the applicability of existing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) techniques within smart farming infrastructures (SFIs). We develop a comprehensive taxonomy of CTI techniques and sources, specifically tailored to the SFI context, addressing the unique cyber threat challenges in this domain. A crucial finding of our review is the identified need for a virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) in smart agriculture. While the concept of a vCISO is not yet established in the agricultural sector, our study highlights its potential significance. The implementation of a vCISO could play a pivotal role in enhancing cybersecurity measures by offering strategic guidance, developing robust security protocols, and facilitating real-time threat analysis and response strategies. This approach is critical for safeguarding the food supply chain against the evolving landscape of cyber threats. Our research underscores the importance of integrating a vCISO framework into smart farming practices as a vital step towards strengthening cybersecurity.

This paper presents a novel semantic- and linguistic-aware model for fake review detection that improves accuracy by leveraging advanced transformer architecture. Our model integrates RoBERTa with an LSTM layer, enabling it to capture intricate patterns within fake reviews. Unlike previous methods, our approach enhances the robustness of fake review detection and authentic behavior profiling. Experimental results on semi-real benchmark datasets show that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 96.03 % accuracy on the OpSpam dataset and 93.15 % on the Deception dataset. To further enhance transparency and credibility, we utilize Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and attention techniques to clarify our model's classifications. The empirical findings indicate that our proposed model can offer rational explanations for classifying specific reviews as fake.}

Additionally, despite the growing interest in personalized Natural Language Processing, recent studies have highlighted limitations in the literature, particularly the lack of explainability methods to interpret the improvements observed in these models. This study explores the CLARIN-Emo dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating personalized and contextual information for accurate emotion detection. By framing textual emotion recognition as a sequence sentence classification (SSC) task and leveraging transformer-based architectures, the proposed multi-source fusion approach significantly outperformed the baseline model, which considers each sentence in isolation. Furthermore, a personalized method, referred to as UserID, captures user-specific characteristics by assigning each annotator a unique identifier, significantly enhancing emotion prediction accuracy. This work also introduces an extension of Data Maps by differentiating dynamic training metrics to analyze the models’ training behaviors. The results validate the capability of this approach in visually interpreting and facilitating performance comparisons between models.}

Recently developed techniques apply adversarial learning to learn domain-transferable features. However, current adversarial domain adaptation models suffer from the training instability of adversarial networks. Furthermore, it is unclear what the source domain pays in terms of performance during learning the domain-transferable representation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach termed Unsupervised DomainAdaptation with Source Preservation (UDA-SP). It shares the same objective of obtaining a generalization representation between different distributions as domain adaptation techniques. Additionally, it has the new objective of preserving efficient performance in the source domain. This is accomplished by learning representations of shared and source-specific features that are separately learned from two distinct networks. Then, they are concatenated with available class information to train a new classifier that has the ability to exploit both shared and domain-specific features. We conducted a comprehensive experimental analysis on three benchmark text datasets. Experiments validate that our proposed method outperforms their competing state-of-the-art methods. Further experiments demonstrate that UDA-SP has a good ability to generalize learned knowledge to unseen domains while maintaining seen domain performance.}

However, the high cost of labeled data and significant differences in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals among individuals limit the cross-domain application of EEG-based emotion recognition models. Addressing cross-dataset scenarios poses greater challenges due to changes in subject demographics, recording devices, and stimuli presented. To tackle these challenges, we propose an improved method for classifying EEG-based emotions across domains with different distributions. We propose a Gradual Proximity-guided Target Data Selection (GPTDS) technique, which gradually selects reliable target domain samples for training based on their proximity to the source clusters and the model’s confidence in predicting them. This approach avoids negative transfer caused by diverse and unreliable samples. Additionally, we introduce a cost-effective test-time augmentation (TTA) technique named Prediction Confidence-aware Test-Time Augmentation (PC-TTA). Traditional TTA methods often face substantial computational burden, limiting their practical utility. By applying TTA only when necessary, based on the model’s predictive confidence, our approach improves the model’s performance during inference while minimizing computational costs compared to traditional TTA approaches. Experiments on the DEAP and SEED datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving accuracies of 67.44% when trained on DEAP and tested on SEED, and 59.68% vice versa, with improvements of 7.09% and 6.07% over the baseline. It excels in detecting both positive and negative emotions, highlighting its effectiveness for practical emotion recognition in healthcare applications. Moreover, our proposed PC-TTA technique reduces computational time by a factor of 15 compared to traditional full TTA approaches.}

Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and categorizing opinions computationally to determine the attitude expressed in the spoken or written text as positive, negative, or neutral. Negation analysis is the task of analyzing the negative opinions by identifying the scope of negation within a sentence and applying linguistic or grammatical rules of the language. In this paper, the rules for identifying the scope of negation within a sentence and the rules applicable to different negation categories are defined. An algorithm by the name SentiNeg has been proposed for processing negations at the sentence level. SentiNeg algorithm filters non-opinionated sentences from the data to avoid unnecessary processing. For opiniated sentences, the algorithm applies different linguistic or grammatical rules of the language to identify negative opinions. SentiNeg algorithm takes opinionated sentences as input and provides a detailed aspect-based summary of negative opinions that are expressed on the entity under analysis.}

abstract = {In the era of sustainable smart agriculture, a vast amount of agricultural news text is posted online, accumulating significant agricultural knowledge. To efficiently access this knowledge, effective text classification techniques are urgently needed. Deep learning approaches, such as fine-tuning strategies on pre-trained language models (PLMs), have shown remarkable performance gains. Nonetheless, these methods face several complex challenges, including limited agricultural training data, poor domain transferability (especially across languages), and complex and expensive deployment of large models. Inspired by the success of recent ChatGPT models (e.g., GPT-3.5, GPT-4), this work explores the potential of applying ChatGPT in the field of agricultural informatization. Various crucial factors, such as prompt construction, answer parsing, and different ChatGPT variants, are thoroughly investigated to maximize its capabilities. A preliminary comparative study is conducted, comparing ChatGPT with PLMs-based fine-tuning methods and PLMs-based prompt-tuning methods. Empirical results demonstrate that ChatGPT effectively addresses the mentioned research challenges and bottlenecks, making it an ideal solution for agricultural text classification. Moreover, ChatGPT achieves comparable performance to existing PLM-based fine-tuning methods, even without fine-tuning on agricultural data samples. We hope this preliminary study could inspire the emergence of a general-purpose AI paradigm for agricultural text processing.}

This issue continues to increase owing to numerous social media platform users and rising popularity. Spammers will use this appealing attention to post videos, texts, and images enclosing deceptive links, which might be employed to propagate negative marketing, sarcasm, rumours, and viruses and capture the consumer's information. Detection of Spam is the current cybersecurity and natural language processing (NLP) research field. Numerous studies have been carried out on this esteem, but they mainly emphasize the English language. Conversely, Arabic tweet spam recognition still has a long manner of driving, primarily highlighting the various dialects except for modern standard Arabic (MSA), so, in the tweets, the standard language is rarely utilized. The condition needs an efficient, automatic, robust Arabic spam tweet recognition technique. This study presents an Integration of Corpus Linguistics with a Deep Learning Model for Arabic Spam and Ham Tweets Detection (ICLDL-ASHTD) technique. The main aim of the ICLDL-ASHTD technique is to classify and detect Arabic spam/Ham tweets. In the ICLDL-ASHTD model, the data preprocessing is primarily performed to transform the input tweets into a standardized format. Furthermore, the Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method is utilized as a feature extractor to produce a feature vector. The ICLDL-ASHTD model utilizes a self-attention bi-directional long short-term memory (SA-BiLSTM) approach for Arabic ham and spam tweet recognition. Finally, the manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) approach is utilized for hyperparameter tuning. The ICLDL-ASHTD technique is validated through simulation using Arabic tweet datasets. The experimental validation of the ICLDL-ASHTD technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.17 % compared to recent methods.}

Social media has become a critical platform for brand management, enabling real-time consumer engagement, sentiment analysis, and influencer-driven marketing. However, existing models often focus on isolated tasks, failing to capture evolving user interactions and sentiment shifts dynamically. To address this, we propose Hybrid Attention-based Personalized Deep Neural Network (HAP-DNN), a unified deep learning framework integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms, hybrid optimization, and personalized brand recommendations. HAP-DNN dynamically prioritizes engagement signals and sentiment cues while employing Moth-Flame Optimization (MFO) for adaptive hyperparameter tuning, improving training efficiency. A transformer-based recommendation module enhances brand suggestions by incorporating real-time user interactions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAP-DNN outperforms five state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 17.5% lower MSE in engagement prediction, a 4.1% improvement in sentiment classification accuracy, and a 6.8% increase in brand loyalty prediction performance.}

Such methods are usually based on traditional learning paradigms requiring the consistency of properties among the feature spaces of the training and test data and also the availability of large amounts of training data, e.g., for performing supervised learning tasks. However, many real-world data do not adhere to such assumptions. In such situations transfer learning can provide feasible solutions, e.g., by simultaneously learning from data-rich source data and data-sparse target data to transfer information for learning a target task. In this paper, we survey deep transfer learning models with a focus on applications to text data. First, we review the terminology used in the literature and introduce a new nomenclature allowing the unequivocal description of a transfer learning model. Second, we introduce a visual taxonomy of deep learning approaches that provides a systematic structure to the many diverse models introduced until now. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information about text data that have been used for studying such models because only by the application of methods to data, performance measures can be estimated and models assessed.}

One critical challenge lies in accurately identifying high-value customers amidst vast amounts of transactional data. Effective predictive models must not only deliver high accuracy but also provide transparency to guide actionable business decisions. Predicting high-value customers is particularly important in these markets due to evolving consumer behaviors and increasing competition. This study introduces an attention-enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict high-value customer behavior in Thailand's e-commerce sector, addressing the challenges of achieving high predictive accuracy while ensuring interpretability. The novelty of this research lies in integrating an attention mechanism within the LSTM framework, enabling the identification of key customer behaviors—such as total purchase amount, purchase frequency, and monthly purchase frequency—that significantly influence high-value customer classification. By leveraging transactional data from a leading Thai e-commerce platform, the model delivers outstanding predictive performance with accuracy rates of 99.75 % (training), 99.77 % (validation), and 99.83 % (testing), coupled with low error metrics (RMSE: 0.0391, MAE: 0.0039). The attention mechanism enhances model transparency by identifying influential behavioral features, thereby enabling actionable insights that align with customer segmentation and targeted marketing strategies. Compared to traditional LSTM models, this approach demonstrates superior predictive power and interpretability, making it an effective tool for e-commerce platforms seeking to optimize customer retention and engagement strategies. This study significantly contributes to advancing machine learning applications in e-commerce by showcasing how attention mechanisms can address the dual needs of predictive accuracy and transparency. The practical benefits of this model are particularly relevant for emerging markets like Thailand, where consumer behaviors and competitive dynamics are evolving rapidly. Future research should investigate the scalability of this approach across diverse datasets and markets, incorporating additional data sources such as demographic and social media information, to further enhance its applicability and robustness.}

Irony, which is a way of expression through the use of the opposite, commonly occurs in daily social media posts. Hence, automatic detection of irony is essential to understand the semantics of informal texts more accurately. The literature has several sentiment analysis studies on Turkish texts, but those focusing on irony detection are very few. This paper investigates the effectiveness of a rich set of supervised learning methods varying from traditional to deep neural solutions on Turkish texts. Traditional irony detection methods such as support vector machine (SVM) and tree-based binary classifiers are analyzed on Turkish informal texts. Furthermore, such methods are extended by polarity-based information and graph-based similarity scores as features. Additionally, neural architecture-based solutions including BERT and various LSTM network models are adapted for the problem. Irony detection performance of all the methods are comparatively analyzed on a data set collected within this study, which is larger than the previously used irony detection data sets in Turkish.}

Although these systems performed well in some specific tasks, they lacked flexibility and scalability and had difficulty in handling complex and changing language phenomena. This study deeply explores the core mechanisms of the Transformer model and its application in natural language processing tasks, focusing on the analysis of self-attention mechanism, multi-head attention mechanism, position encoding, and encoder-decoder structure. The self-attention mechanism adjusts the word vector representation by calculating the similarity between each input word and other words, thereby capturing the dependencies between words in the sequence. Position encoding solves the problem that the Transformer model lacks a time order processing mechanism, provides position information for each Token, and ensures the understanding of the sequence order. In addition, this paper also analyzes the encoder and decoder structure of Transformer, where the encoder is responsible for converting the input sequence into a context representation, and the decoder combines the output of the encoder to generate the target sequence. Experimental results show that the Transformer model has significant advantages in understanding complex and long texts and performing deep semantic reasoning, especially in multi-level reasoning tasks and cross-paragraph information integration. The model’s personalized recommendation capabilities and contextual adaptability are also excellent, and it can provide accurate understanding and recommendations based on the needs of different users.}

Nevertheless, cognitive security is a complex concept that requires a more granular description. In this article, we redefine cognitive security by first analysing the state of the art to derive the current state of practice and the definitions of cognitive security. Next, we expand the concept of cognitive security by analysing its multiple pillars, including learning theories, AI technologies, human–computer interactions, and the ethical and legal aspects impacting its development and implementation. The latter is crucial towards understanding cognitive security, providing insight into its potential and prerequisites towards its realisation while emphasising its multidisciplinary nature. In addition to such a description, we analyse the current challenges in three closely interconnected fields, namely cybersecurity, digital forensics, and digital investigations, to provide a taxonomy that can be used to assess the current challenges and limitations of cognitive security and understand its potential better. Finally, we propose future research directions, aiming to develop cognitive systems capable of continuous learning, adaptation, and ethical compliance in dynamic cybersecurity environments.

These limitations hinder the accurate prediction of consumer actions, especially in evolving markets where user preferences change over time. To address these challenges, the authors propose deep behavioral and sentiment-aware personalized recommendation model, a novel approach that integrates dynamic user behavior modeling and sentiment analysis within a hybrid recommendation framework.

Experiments carried out on two real review datasets from Yelp.com – Hotel and Restaurant – show that the use of multi-view learning can improve the performance of a deep learning classifier trained for review spam detection. In particular, the proposed approach achieves AUC-ROC equal to 0.813 and 0.708 in Hotel and Restaurant, respectively.}

This paper presents a guide for researchers encountering real-world data-driven applications, and the respective challenges associated with this. This article proposes the concept of the Data Learning Paradigm, combining the principles of machine learning, data science and data assimilation to tackle real-world challenges in data-driven applications. Models are a product of the data upon which they are trained, and no data collected from real world scenarios is perfect due to natural limitations of sensing and collection. Thus, computational modelling of real world systems is intrinsically limited by the various deficiencies encountered in real data. The Data Learning Paradigm aims to leverage the strengths of data improvement to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of data-driven models. We outline a range of methods which are currently being implemented in the field of Data Learning involving machine learning and data science methods, and discuss how these mitigate the various problems associated with data-driven models, illustrating improved results in a multitude of real world applications. We highlight examples where these methods have led to significant advancements in fields such as environmental monitoring, planetary exploration, healthcare analytics, linguistic analysis, social networks, and smart manufacturing. We offer a guide to how these methods may be implemented to deal with general types of limitations in data, alongside their current and potential applications.}

Moreover, manual annotation by human annotators can lead to varying degrees of competency, training, and experience, which can result in inconsistent labeling and arbitrary standards. To address these challenges, researchers have been exploring automated methods for enhancing training and testing datasets. This paper proposes SRL-ACO, a novel text augmentation framework that leverages Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) techniques to generate additional training data for natural language processing (NLP) models. The framework uses SRL to identify the semantic roles of words in a sentence and ACO to generate new sentences that preserve these roles. SRL-ACO can enhance the accuracy of NLP models by generating additional data without requiring manual data annotation. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of SRL-ACO on seven text classification datasets for sentiment analysis, toxic text detection and sarcasm identification. The results show that SRL-ACO improves the performance of a classifier on different NLP tasks. These results demonstrate that SRL-ACO has the potential to enhance the quality and quantity of training data for various NLP tasks.}

These disorders significantly impair millions of individuals’ cognitive and behavioral functions worldwide. Our study aims to advance the understanding of four prevalent mental disorders: Anorexia, Depression, Gambling, and Self-harm. We present a comprehensive framework designed for the domain adaptation of models to analyze and identify signs of these conditions on social media posts. The language models’ adapting strategy consisted of three key stages. First, we gathered and enriched substantial data on the four psychological disorders. Second, we adapted the different models to the language used to discuss mental health concerns on social media. Finally, we employed an adapter to fine-tune the models for multiple classification tasks (specific to each mental health condition). The intuitive idea is to adapt a language model smoothly to each domain. Our work includes a comparative study of different language models under in- and cross-domain conditions. This allows us to, for example, assess the ability of a depression-based language model to detect signs of disorders such as anorexia or self-harm. We show that the resulting mental health models perform well in early risk detection tasks. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the linguistic qualities of these models by testing their predictive abilities using conventional clinical tools, such as specialized questionnaires. We rigorously examine the models across multiple predictive tasks to provide evidence of the adaptation approach’s robustness and effectiveness. Our evaluation results are promising. They demonstrate that our framework enhances classification performance and competes favorably with state-of-the-art models.}

This article conducts a widespread investigation of multilingual hate speech across 11 languages sourced from various datasets. By utilizing methods such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and deep learning, researchers aim to create models that can effectively generalize across different languages. In low-resource scenarios, simpler models like LASER embeddings combined with logistic regression outperform ELMo-based models in high-resource contexts.

abstract = {The detection of automated accounts, also known as “social bots”, has been an important concern for online social networks (OSNs). While several methods have been proposed for detecting social bots, significant research gaps remain. First, current models exhibit limitations in detecting sophisticated bots that aim to mimic genuine OSN users. Second, these methods often rely on simplistic profile features, which are susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In addition, these models lack generalizability, resulting in subpar performance when trained on one dataset and tested on another. To address these challenges, we propose a framework for social Bot detection with Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (BotSSCL). Our framework leverages contrastive learning to distinguish between social bots and humans in the embedding space to improve linear separability. The high-level representations derived by BotSSCL enhance its resilience to variations in data distribution and ensure generalizability. We evaluate BotSSCL’s robustness against adversarial attempts to manipulate bot accounts to evade detection. Experiments on two datasets featuring sophisticated bots demonstrate that BotSSCL outperforms other supervised, unsupervised, and self-supervised baseline methods. We achieve ≈6% and ≈8% higher (F1) performance than SOTA on both datasets. In addition, BotSSCL also achieves 67% F1 when trained on one dataset and tested with another, demonstrating its generalizability under cross-botnet evaluation. Lastly, under adversarial evasion attack, BotSSCL shows increased complexity for the adversary and only allows 4% success to the adversary in evading detection. The code is available at https://github.com/code4thispaper/BotSSCL.}

While traditional NLP methods often necessitate specialized expertise to build rule-based systems or train machine learning models with domain-specific datasets, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) driven by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents a promising alternative. These models offer accessibility, alleviating challenges associated with model construction from scratch and reducing the dependency on extensive datasets during the training phase, thus facilitating rapid implementation. However, challenges persist in handling domain-specific tasks, leading to the development of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG enhances LLMs by integrating external data retrieval, enriching their contextual understanding, and expanding their knowledge base beyond pre-existing training data. To illustrate RAG’s efficacy, we introduce the Political EE system, specifically tailored to extract political event information from news articles.

In this paper, we attempt to analyse tweets of politicians from three European countries and explore the virality of their tweets. Previous studies have shown that tweets conveying negative sentiment are likely to be retweeted more frequently. By utilising state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, we performed sentiment analysis on hundreds of thousands of tweets collected from members of parliament in Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom, including devolved administrations. We achieved this by systematically exploring and analysing the differences between influential and less popular tweets.

In this article, we review recent progress in topics ranging from WiFi hardware platforms to sensing algorithms and propose a new library with a comprehensive benchmark, SenseFi. On this basis, we evaluate various deep-learning models in terms of distinct sensing tasks, WiFi platforms, recognition accuracy, model size, computational complexity, and feature transferability. Extensive experiments are performed whose results provide valuable insights into model design, learning strategy, and training techniques for real-world applications.

abstract = {Aspect-based sentiment analysis refers to the task of determining the sentiment polarity associated with particular aspects mentioned in a sentence or document. Previous studies have used attention-based neural network models to connect aspect terms with context words, but these models often perform poorly due to limited interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. Furthermore, these models typically focus only on explicitly stated aspect objects, which can be overly restrictive in certain scenarios. Current sentiment analysis methods that rely on aspect categories also often fail to consider the implicit placement of aspect-category information within the context. While existing models may produce strong results, they often lack domain knowledge. To address these issues, this study proposes an Aspect-position and Entity-oriented Knowledge Convolutional Graph (APEKCG) consisting of two modules: the Aspect position-aware module (APA) and the Entity oriented Knowledge Dependency Convolutional Graph (EKDCG). The APA module is designed to integrate aspect-specific sentiment features for sentiment classification by incorporating information about aspect categories into different parts of the context. The EKDCG module incorporates entity-oriented knowledge, dependency labels, and syntactic path using a dependence graph. Experimental results on five benchmarks Natural Language Processing (NLP) datasets of the English language demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed APEKCG framework. Furthermore, the APEKCG outperformed previous state-of-the-art models with its accuracy, achieving 89.13%, 84.32%, 89.02%, 79.64%, and 90.22% on the MAMS, Laptop, Restaurant, AWARE, and SemEval-15&16 datasets, respectively.}

abstract = {Early detection of heart failure (HF) can provide patients with the opportunity for more timely intervention and better disease management, as well as efficient use of healthcare resources. Recent machine learning (ML) methods have shown promising performance on diagnostic prediction using temporal sequences from electronic health records (EHRs). In practice, however, these models may not generalize to other populations due to dataset shift. Shifts in datasets can be attributed to a range of factors such as variations in demographics, data management methods, and healthcare delivery patterns. In this paper, we use unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation methods to adaptively reduce the impact of dataset shift on cross-institutional transfer performance. The proposed framework is validated on a next-visit HF onset prediction task using a BERT-style Transformer-based language model pre-trained with a masked language modeling (MLM) task. Our model empirically demonstrates superior prediction performance relative to non-adversarial baselines in both transfer directions on two different clinical event sequence data sources.}

Among them, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) stands out as one of the best-known methods. However, the complexity of TRIZ and its reliance on users’ knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities limit its practicality. To address this, we introduce AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging LLMs’ vast pre-trained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, AutoTRIZ offers a novel, generative, and interpretable approach to engineering innovation. AutoTRIZ takes a problem statement from the user as its initial input, automatically conduct the TRIZ reasoning process and generates a structured solution report. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through comparative experiments with textbook cases and a real-world application in the design of a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS). Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, such as SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of AI-driven innovation tools.}

Federated learning (FL) can achieve many intelligent IoT applications by training models on local devices and allowing AI training on distributed IoT devices without data sharing. This review aims to deeply explore the combination of FL and the IoT, and analyze the application of federated learning in the IoT from the aspects of security and privacy protection. In this paper, we first describe the potential advantages of FL and the challenges faced by current IoT systems in the fields of network burden and privacy security. Next, we focus on exploring and analyzing the advantages of the combination of FL on the Internet, including privacy security, attack detection, efficient communication of the IoT, and enhanced learning quality.

abstract = {The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods, such as autoregressive or spatio-temporal models, is often extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight (called ‘next-day morning traffic prediction’ thereafter). In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people’s work and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people’s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning (by 5am) are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute congestion using people’s tweeting profiles extracted by 5am. In most cases, the tweet information collected by the midnight before is sufficient to make good prediction for next-day morning traffic. The Pittsburgh study supports that this framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion variation, while its prediction performance being no worse than baseline methods on other roads. Through experiments, we demonstrate our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights. The proposed social media empowered framework can be a promising tool for real-time traffic management and potentially extended for traffic prediction at other times of day.}

abstract = {Recently, aspect-level sentiment analysis methods using graph convolutional network (GCN)-based structures with fairly good performance have been introduced. However, previous GCN-based methods often experience one of the following limitations. First, GCNs usually use edges with binary weights. However, binary weights are not helpful in many tasks. Second, these GCNs only focus on extracting node features from some single words or phrases and ignore their context in the entire sentence or paragraph or only consider the information of independent phrases when determining the relation between two graph edges overlooking the semantic relation among these phrases. Finally, no studies simultaneously use the information on the context, the semantic relation, and the sentiment knowledge among words or phrases to build GCNs for aspect-level sentiment analysis. Therefore, to resolve these limitations, in this study, we propose a new method, the CANN-SSCG model, as follows. First, we built three separate heterogeneous graphs, namely, syntax-based, semantic-based, and context-based graphs. Second, we constructed a general heterogeneous graph (SSC graph) by combining the three constructed graphs. We then converted the nodes of the SSC graph into sentence vectors using a GCN with two layers (creating an SSC-GCN). Finally, we used a convolutional neural network algorithm with attention to position embeddings (CANN) on the output of the SSC-GCN model for aspect-level sentiment analysis. The experiments, which used three different datasets, including reviews and tweets, showed that the proposed method yields promising results based on the F1score.}
